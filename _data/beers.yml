  Review: Dark brown, with hints of red. Small, tan head with a reasonable amount
    of carbonation. Smells of roasted malt, with some burnt notes and a bit of sourness.
    Taste is similar; it's a bit like a dunkel or schwarzbier rather than a stout.
    Not brilliant, but much better than the standard lager offerings in China.

  Review: Clear, orangey copper with a thick, slightly off-white head, which is long-lasting.
    Smell is a mix of hops and sweet, roasted malts. Taste is similar, but perhaps
    with a little spice. Has more body than the other alts, so less quaffable but
    very nice, with a little more flavour.

  Review: Hazy golden with a fine white head. Slight sour notes with some fruit and
    sweetness. Also an odd dirty-dishwater overtone. Taste is caramelized sugar and
    dirtyiness. Lots of alcohol and some sweet fruit. A weird sourness means it's
    a bit bland but remarkably offensive at the same time.

    and Christmas aromas. Triple hopped, but not a huge amount of hop flavour, and
    also quite sweet.

    bottle conditioning. Complex aroma, definite alcohol notes, along with caramel
    sweetness, carob, and mild dark fruit. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, but very smooth,

  Review: Golden with a bubbly white head. Slightly bitter hop aroma, but not a lot
    going on. Fizzy mouthfeel. Actually tastes quite lagery (more pils than helles)
    but is nicely drinkable. Perhaps a little smokiness in the finish.

  Review: Clear and bright, golden in colour. Smells of citrus with a little malt
    sweetness. Very light, with perhaps not enough biddy. Some malts and a hop bitterness.
    Nicely carbonated from the bottle conditioning. Dry finish, which becomes more
    pronounced the more you drink.

  Review: (Zero IBU IPA.) Hazy golden with very little head. Had at a beer tasting,
    with two very different results. One smells of smoke and yeast, the other of grapefruit
    with slight vinegar notes; cloudier ones smell smokier. Cloudy one has yeast and
    marmite in the taste, whilst the clearer one has grapefruit citrus and bitterness.
    Oddly, not as good as either when they are mixed. Some sweetness builds throughout.

  Review: As you'd expect from something that's mass-marketed, it's very smooth and
    gentle, and, whilst it's not a patch on the export bottled versions, it's an excellent
    choice that's widely available. Famous black with white head, has roasted malts
    and a faint hop tang that is all blended together expertly. Not too heavy to drink
    a `few' pints in an evening.

    drinkable, smooth and refreshing. Perhaps a little undercarbonated, but it's a
    cask ale so I shouldn't really complain.

  Review: Dark black with a frothy white head, which lingers with good lacing. Smells
    of roasted malts with some chocolate sweetness. Very smooth with roasted malts,
    and then a little hop bitterness to make it interesting. Slightly sweet aftertaste,
    but incredibly clean and drinkable. A very nice mild.

  Review: At 8 a (large) bottle, I was hoping for something special and this didn't
    disappoint! Has been World Stout Champion, and it's clear why. Pours jet black,
    with a creamy brown (darker than tan) head, which lasts well. Smells of hops and
    spices, with a hint of burnt coffee. Creamy, but not as full a mouthfeel as some
    stouts. Contrasts with the pour, which is surprisingly fizzy. Very well rounded,
    with roasted malts and a nicely balancing bitter, dry aftertaste from the hops.
    Some berry notes. Surprisingly clean for a stout, which leads to it being incredibly
    drinkable.

  Review: A Trappist-style dubbel, brewed to celebrate the brewery's 3rd birthday
    and 200th brew. Ruby and cloudy with a large, but quickly vanishing head. Dark,
    roasted malts, with a little sourness. A bit odd, sort of a cross between a German
    dunkel and a dubbel, with a bit of gueuze. I quite liked it, others hated it.

  Review: Very frothy (bottle conditioned). Cloudy, dark brown with a large, slightly
    tan head. Aroma is quite busy, with alcohol notes, malt and some rum. Some tingly
    carbonation. Taste has spices (clove) and slightly sweet alcohol undertone, balanced
    by roasted malt. More clove and alcohol in the aftertaste.

  Review: Quite dark for a weissbier, almost copper. Not a lot of aroma gets past
    the large head, perhaps some banana and spice. Not as powerful a taste as some
    other weisses, has a long sweet finish after the usual banana and spice.

  Review: Sold as a rice beer, but also contains grain. Clear yellow with a small
    white head. Light aroma with some grass and maybe citrus. Taste is equally light,
    with some lemon. Good with spicy food.

  Review: Very clear golden with a few bubbles of carbonation but no real head. Aroma
    is all peat with associated smokiness. Taste is also dominated by smoke initially,
    with definite campfire notes. Some bitterness comes later though with a dry finish.
    Definitely interesting.

  Review: Actually a gooseberry sour IPA. Clear golden with rapidly-vanishing white
    head that leaves a sticky lacing. Sour aroma, but not overpowering. Definite fruit
    notes. Quite fizzy with a gooseberry tang, which lingers into the finish.

  Review: Bottle, but only for the journey between Banbury and Coventry. Copper with
    a little carbonation. Smells sweet with some hopping. Good mouthfeel and quite
    a well-balanced combination of malt and hops. Perhaps a little too sweet and green,
    but Alan reckoned it could do with another week or two anyway.
