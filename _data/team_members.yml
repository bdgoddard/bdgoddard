  project: Tim did his first year extended project with me on non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics in two dimensions. He is now working on dynamical density functional theory for hard particles, which has a wide range of applications in the predictive modelling and analysis of industrial processes.

  project: Rory is working on the dynamics of suspensions of hard particles, in particular the inclusion of short-range hydrodynamic interactions (lubrication forces) in both particle-based methods and statistical mechanics. Rory is also interested in the rigorous analysis of DDFT-like equations.  He completed his viva in January 2020.

  project: Mildred did her first year extended project on PDE-constrained optimization, in particular focusing on the inclusion of non-local terms, which are vital for many particle-based models, such as in complex fluids, opinion formation, or drone control. She is now extending this work through a combination of rigorous analysis and numerics.
