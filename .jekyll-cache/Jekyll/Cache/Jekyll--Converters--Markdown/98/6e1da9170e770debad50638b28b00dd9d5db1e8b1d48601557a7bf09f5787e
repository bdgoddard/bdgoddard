<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dampfbier ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Chestnut with a large, rapidly-vanishing head. Smells of slightly burnt malt. Quite thin with not a lot going on, but it is very quaffable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Pfeffer Hell ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden with a small, tight white head. Smells grainy with lemon notes. Taste is similar and seems more like a Belgian wit than a Helles. However, that doesn’t stop it from being very nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Zwickl ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly explodey from a flip top bottle. Hazy golden with a large, vanishing off-white head. Looks a lot like a weissbier. Slightly sweet nose with some malt, a bit like a strong-smelling helles. Clean, smooth and mellow, with a bit of sharpness in the finish. Nicely drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p><span class="beers_brewery">71 Brewing</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Passion Killer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear orange with very little head. Aroma is mostly sour. Quite a tingly mouthfeel. Initial sour notes lead into a passionfruit finish. Clean and very drinkable, with a tingly, fruity finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">8 Sail Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Oat Malt Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with no head. Smells bitter and roasted. Quite a lot of fizz. Roast and sourness. Less creamy than I was expecting from an oat stout. OK.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old Colony ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with no head. Aroma of fruity, resinous hops. Lots of bitterness, some touches of fruit and resin in the finish. Dry, lingering aftertaste. Pretty clean and standard.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">ABC</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Aston Distressway ★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Leffe Bière de Printemps ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with a froth of off-white head. Smells of fruit with caramel sweetness, yeast, bread and a little smoke. Sweet malt and alcohol notes with a dry, bitter finish. Not a huge amount going on and lacking the richness of normal Leffe.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Leffe Blonde ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep golden colour. Smells slightly of fruit, reminiscent of a weissbier. Smooth and strong tasting, creamy yet with a slight tingle. Some sweetness in the aftertaste but balanced by bitterness. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Leffe Blonde 0.0% ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a white head - looks like Leffe. That’s pretty much where the similarity ends. Dominated by sweetness and malt with some bitterness and maybe clove. Typically of low-alcohol beers like this it tastes underdone and lacks body.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Leffe Royale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a creamy white head. Sweet malt, Belgian yeast, alcohol and more hopping than a standard Leffe, both in the aroma and the taste. A very nice sipping beer that develops a very slight smokiness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">

  </span>
  <span class="beers_abv">5.0%</span>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bron India Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy amber with thick white head. Aroma of sweet malt and maybe some floral notes. Not a huge amount going on in the taste, especially since it’s supposed to be an IPA. Decent beer though.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Barnsley Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper, with a slightly off-white head. Some roasted coffee notes with a bit of burnt caramel. Other than that, it’s a pretty standard, but drinkable, bitter.</p>

  Ekuarillo ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with tight white head. A slightly strange mix of sweetness, biscuit malt and dry American-style hops. Pretty good, but I’m not sure it knows what it’s trying to be. A bit sweet for me, too.</p>

  Arbor Single Hop ★★★★

  <br />Pale golden with good citrus bitterness from the hops. Definite lemon notes and very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Breakfast Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with a tan head. Interesting mix of coffee, roasted malt and smoke in the aroma. Coffee and bitterness dominate in the mouth until the aftertaste when it’s all smoke. Very interesting, and something genuinely different.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Motueka ★★★

  Kingsdown Special ★★★

  <br />Dark copper. Smells malty and slightly bitter-sweet. Quite sweet taste with fruity hops in the lingering, bitter finish. Quite dangerously drinkable given the ABV, but a little unexciting.</p>

  Arran Blonde ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear, golden-blonde in colour, with a white head. Smell is mostly hops, as is the taste. Lowe carbonation with a little bitterness and some floral notes. Very summery beer, you could drink a lot of this.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Arran Dark ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown rather than black. Aroma is slightly sweet with some caramel and roasted malt. Taste is very similar, with some subtle fruit and hops. It seems simple, but it’s done very well.</p>

  Clyde Puffer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with define red hues. Tight off-white head. Some sweetness and roast malt in the aroma.  Surprisingly tingly in the mouth. Quite light and sweet. Could do with being smoother. May be a good summer stout.</p>

  Monkey IPA ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tiger Beer ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Radiation ★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep ruby colour. Tastes of alcohol, raisins, alcohol and alcohol. Maybe a touch of bitterness in the finish, but it’s rather overpowered by the erm, what’s the word, oh yeah, alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Strike ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Apparently an American style pale ale. Golden in colour, with citrus (lemon/grapefruit) aroma. Easy drinking, with citrus and sweet malt. Drying finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Augustiner Münchner Dunkel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear, dark brown and very little head Smells of roasted malt, soy sauce, some smoke and slightly burnt notes. A bit thin and uninteresting; could do with doing a bit more.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Edelstoff ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />This is a seriously good lager. Golden in colour with a large white head. Smells og citrus hops and grass. More complex taste than a typical helles, some lemony hops and grain. Nicely balanced and not too fizzy. Very drinkable, and would be an excellent session beer if you didn’t mind getting drunk.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Maximator ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep mahogany in colour, with a small, lacy tan head. Smells sweet with caramel, some alcohol, and dark fruit. Taste is sweet malt with soy sauce. Heavy-bodied and doesn’t really do enough to make it special.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Fursty Ferret ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber beer, with a slight hoppy aroma. Well rounded, with a little sweetness and distinctive Badger taste. Very refreshing session beer with a slightly hoppy finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Golden Champion ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a slight head. Smells of elderflower, with some citrus fruit. Taste is a little sweet, with some fruit and flowers. Nicely bitter finish. Perhaps a little too flowery.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Golden Glory ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a white head. Aroma has definite peach, but it smells a bit fake. Light tasting otherwise, but dominated by sweetness after a while. Not great.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hopping Hare ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Bright, pale golden with white head. As you’d expect, it’s pretty hoppy, dominated by citrus and tangy bitterness. Very drinkable and exactly what you’d expect from a Badger beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

  </span>
  <br />Reddish brown. Tastes of fruit and liquorice. Reminds me a lot of snakebite and black.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  River Cottage Stinger ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Yellow gold with a white head. Aroma is grassy with something else green, that I presume it’s the nettles. Light bodied and slightly watery. However, it’s very refreshing with a nice bitterness to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rothaus Hefe Weizen ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy straw coloured with a foamy white head which disappears surprisingly quickly. Smells bready with a little pineapple and some yeast. Taste is dryer and more acidic than I was expecting. Still, a pretty good weissbier.</p>

  Rothaus Märzen Export ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with moderate carbonation and a largish white foamy head. Smells of hay and hope with a little sweetness. Taste is similar, a bit of a standard Märzen, but very well balanced. Not too fizzy and pretty fresh.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rothaus Pils ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very clear yellow/golde with a small white head which vanishes pretty quickly. Smells dry with hops and some sweetness, much as you’d expect from a pils. Nice grainy taste with some balancing hops and a bitter aftertaste. Somewhat light in body, but nicely refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Blonde Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy light golden with a very small white head. A bit dull but would be a good session beer if there’s nothing better available. Hints of an un-spiced Belgian wit.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Cascadian Dark ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a creamy tan head. Smells of floral and citrus hops. Taste similar, with roasted malts and a full hop flavour. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bank Top</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Bank Top Blonde ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale. Smells weird - wood/something else. Ok taste, but slightly astringent finish spoils it somewhat.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bank’s Mild ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid-brown with a foamy, slightly tan head. Aroma is roasted malt. Slightly fizzy with a little bitterness. Medium body, mostly roasted malts, and lacks slightly in other flavour.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Bank’s Original ★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly sweet, almost fruity. Otherwise, very generic, with an smoothflow style head. Seems to be catering to the masses; there are so many better beers out there.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Black Dragon Mild ★★★★
  </span>

  <br />Pale golden. Smells slightly spicy with some sweetness. Taste is similar with slight alcohol notes and some hoppiness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Lapsang Smoked Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with small off-white head. Definitely smells smoky. Quite dry in the mouth with plenty of smoke, especially in the lingering finish. Bitterness builds after a while. A very nice rauchbier.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Red Rye ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark reddish brown. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is slightly sweet with some spice and malt. Decent but unspectacular.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Vital Juices ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma of citrus and pine. Taste has more citrus and some hop bitterness. Described as a session IPA, and that’s pretty much exactly what it is.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Volcano IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with lots of bubbles and a bubbly white head. Fruity hops in the aroma. Lots of dry hops in the taste, balanced by some fruitiness in the finish and then returning to a long dry aftertaste. Almost some menthol as well. Very nice.</p>

  Dark Mild ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Oddly, but not offensively, bitter for a mild. Low strength, combined with a reasonable taste leads to a good session beer; not overly exciting though.</p>

  England Expects ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a caramel sweetness in both the aroma and taste. Slight dryness in the finish, along with some residual bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Summer Swallow ★★

  Birds of a Feather ★★★

  Dark Side of the Geek ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slight red hints to a dark-brown body with a sticky, very slightly off-white head. Smells of roasted malts with some dry, chocolate and malt, with something weird added in. Taste is a bit thin and disjointed, it’s not bad, just unexciting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Geek Unique ★★

  Yanjing Ice Beer ★★

  Yanjing Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown, with hints of red. Small, tan head with a reasonable amount of carbonation. Smells of roasted malt, with some burnt notes and a bit of sourness.

  Belhaven 80/- ★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Belhaven Black ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, almost black with a light tan head. Smells rich and roasted with a full and creamy mouthfeel with a little tingle. Lots of roast malts with a slightly bitter finish to round things off. Very nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bridge to Nowhere ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with quite a lot of fizz. Not a huge amount of head. Tropical fruit hops and bitterness in the nose. Taste is mostly bitterness with a little light malt. Drinkable with a nice finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Golden Bay ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Gold with a white head. Malty aroma and taste, with a building bitterness. Bittersweet finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Grand Slam ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a finger or so of white head. Smells of light malt and hops, with a hint of sweetness. Similar flavours with a nice level of carbonation. Very drinkable and a fine session beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Robert Burns Brown Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Chestnut brown with no head. A bit of malt and sweetness in the aroma. Taste is similar; just what you expect from a brown ale. Quite subtle, but drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Scottish Oat Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with small light brown head. Smells of roasted make with some salt? Taste is rich and complex with coffee and chocolate sweetness backed up by a bitter finish. Quite tingly with alcohol notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Speyside Oak Aged Blonde Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a definite oak and vanilla aroma and notes of whisky. Taste is sweet vanilla with a sticky mouthfeel. Not sold on it at all.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  St Andrew’s Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with no head. Smells malty with some sweetness. Tastes like a dull version of Newcastle Brown.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St. Andrews Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured. Quite fizzy with sweet malt. Very generic, but drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Twisted Thistle ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden yellow with fine white bubbles of head. Slight grapefruit citrus aroma. Quite bitter with a good fizz and a building grapefruit aftertaste. Pretty good but nothing outstanding.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lawless Village IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Gluten free. Copper coloured. Malt and citrus hops on the nose. Clean with some dryness and light fruit notes. A slightly tingly, bitter finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Berliner Kindl Brauerei</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Berliner Kindl Weisse ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale, hazy yellow colour, with a rapidly dissolving head. Very fizzy. Smell and taste are very sour, with lemon and almost-vinegar notes. Long sour finish. Think lemon gueuze or alcoholic lemonade.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Berliner Pilsner ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Yep, it’s a pils. Quite a sharp one.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bernard</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bernard Amber Free ★★★
  </span>
  <br />This is surprisingly good. There’s lots of malt going on, which helps to mask the usual alcohol-free notes. It’s a bit like a dark Newcastle Brown. Quite sweet with malt notes and a bit if carbonation.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bexley</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bexley’s Own Beer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brown. Has fruity (apple) notes and some hops. Building bitter finish. Drinkable but nothing special.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  La Trappe Blond ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden amber colour with little head. Some alcohol notes in the aroma with a mild hoppiness. Some yeast and spice notes. Taste is sweet malts with some herbal notes. Medium body and carbonation gives it a clean finish, although also slightly syrupy overall. I’d much prefer a Vedett White.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  La Trappe Dubbel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a finger of tan head which vanishes to lacing quite quickly. Caramel malt aroma, with some dark fruits. Taste is sweeter than I expected, perhaps dark fruit. Some alcohol notes. Reasonably drinkable but unexciting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  La Trappe Isid’or ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Medium brown, hazy with a small, tight head with little lacing. Smells of malt and perhaps a little fruit, some candy sugar. Slightly creamy with a smooth mouthfeel and a little spice in the finish. Some peach flavours with a little sugar sweetness. I found this to be a bit dull.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  La Trappe Quadrupel ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />An oak aged Trappist beer. Copper-red colour with small off-white head. Lots of aroma, mostly malts, with some fruit sweetness. Flavour is roasted malts with some dark fruits and a little grass/wood. Medium carbonation with a dry finish. Expensive, but my favourite La Trappe.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  La Trappe Tripel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep amber colour with minimal head but some thick lacing. Smells of Belgian candy sugar with some hints of fruit. Taste is quite sweets, with some malts and candy sugar again. Some alcohol notes and a reasonably thick mouthfeel. Not a bad triple but not a brilliant one either.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  La Trappe Witte ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy straw colour with a large bubbly head which vanishes quite quickly. Aroma is wheat with some banana and a little spice. Medium bodied with some sweetness and spice (coriander?). Hints of citrus. Fresh finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bierbrouwerij Sint Christoffel</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Christoffel Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale, hazy golden in colour with small head that fades to lacing. Smells of apples, maybe some honey sweetness. Tastes mostly bready with some apple tartness. Slightly metallic aftertaste, but other than that quite well-balanced and the apple makes it refreshing</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Christoffel Robertus ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with a small tan head. Good carbonation with a malty, slightly sweet aroma with some alcohol notes. Roasted malt flavour but gets boring very quickly.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bieres de Chimay</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Chimay Blue ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mahogany colour with a small tan head, which has a little lacing. Smells of alcohol, raisin-like fruit and brown sugar. Tastes similar, with some rum notes and dark fruit accompanying the bready malt. Definite alcohol, but very well rounded and very enjoyable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Chimay Red ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber-red with a slightly-off-white head, which has very good retention and lacing. Smooth mouthfeel despite the high level of carbonation. Smells sweet with some peppery spice. Taste is mostly malt with some hops in the background providing a nice balance. Slightly sour aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Chimay White ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy orange with a creamy white head. Smells clean, with some spice notes. Smooth yet crisp mouthfeel. More alcohol than you’d expect in the taste, along with some crisp dryness and malt sweetness. Good, but not outstanding.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cinq Cents ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with large frothy white head. Smells yeasty and dry. Spicy and sweet. Complex and drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mont des Cats ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells alcoholic with some spice. Taste is mainly banana. Dark copper/brown with a very small white head. More like a weissbier than a trappist, but pretty good.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Big Lamp Brewery</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Keelman Brown ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with reddish hues and a just off-white head. Roasted malt, some nuttiness and alcohol in the aroma. Very smooth with some toffee sweetness and a lingering light bitterness. Mmm…</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Pele’s Pint ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with tight white head. Smells slightly flower. Nice mix of floral and fruity hops leading to a dry finish. Excellent after a long walk!</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Premium Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper. Dominated by dark frit and alcohol. Slightly unbalanced but still drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Prince Bishop Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with tight white head. Smells rich and fruity with some alcohol notes. Very clean tasting with fruity hop bitterness. A good pint but could do a bit more given the abv.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Summerhill Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with off-white head. Roasted malt with coffee in both the nose and mouth. Leading to a roasted finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  Big Rock IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a very fine white head. Smells of resinous and slightly floral hops. Taste is similar with some dry bitterness and a slight tingle in the mouth. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Grasshopper ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with small bubbles of white head. Not a huge amount of aroma or taste, but clean and would be a good session beer. Quite like a light helles.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Big Shed Brewery</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Rocky Mountain ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with loads of American style hops in the aroma. Well balanced, refreshing and a good body and mouthfeel. Very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Birra Menabrea</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Menabrea ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with fine streams of carbonation and a patchy white head. Smells grassy. Tastes similar with a little sweetness and some dry spicing. Not bad, especially for a pale lager.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bitburger</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bitburger Pils ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A fairly average pils, but that doesn’t stop it being very drinkable if you fancy something light. Refreshing, but definitely not exciting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Black Dog</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bite ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden. Smells of grassy hops. Good hit of bitterness in an otherwise slightly grassy and clean lager.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Chomp ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with lacy white head. Smells a bit green. Tastes quite like a fizzy generic bitter with some sweetness followed by a bitter finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Black Hole Brewery</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Milky Way ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden in colour, with large head and little aroma. Taste is light citrus, drinkable but unexciting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Black Iris</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Circle of Snakes ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy yellow. Lots of tropical fruit notes in the aroma. Taste has citrus and grapefruit with a sweet finish. Possibly not with the ABV. A bit sticky.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Black Isle</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  20 Hours of Daylight ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Rhubarb and elderflower. Pale golden with small white head with lots of lacing. Smells sweet and sour, with rhubarb notes. Taste is mostly fruit with some sourness and a sweet finish. A little bit of fizz. Could almost be a cider.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  23 Trees ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with quite a lot of carbonation. Citrus and pine aroma. Slightly sweet with malt, some citrus zest, plenty of spice and a peppery finish. A bit sticky.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Goldfinch ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a tight white head. Light bitter and fruity hop aroma. Taste is similar - not a powerfully hopped IPA, but very clean and drinkable. A slight fizz to the finish. Wouldn’t know that it’s gluten free.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Hibernator ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark black with small creamy tan head. Creamy with a slight tingle and a touch of alcohol. Roast malt and some dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Migrator ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a slight haze. Frothy white head. Aroma of tropical fruit. Full taste with malt and a hit of resinous hops and a bitter finish. Quite fizzy.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Organic Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Unsurprisingly black with a very large, frothy Duvel-style head. Smells of roasted malt, which is also dominant in the mouth. Also some smoke and earthy notes. Overall it’s clean and light but with plenty of flavour and well-balanced.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Red Kite Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Red-brown with bubbly off-white head. Smells sweet with some fruity hops. Very fizzy. Malt is dominant with faint hop notes. Not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Yellowhammer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with very little head. Light, fresh hop aroma. Taste is also light and refreshing with a nice hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Black Metal Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Will-o’-the-Wisp ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown with small off-white head. Very light smoke in the nose. Some fizz and definite alcohol in the initial taste. Smoke slowly builds, leading to a lingering aftertaste. A good introductory smoked beer. Don’t really get any of the juniper.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Black Rock</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden. Slight hop aroma. Has tropical fruit, honey and earthy malts. Taste slightly dirty but builds to a perfectly OK beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Black Sheep</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Baa Baa ★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a very standard golden ale. Some tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Bitter and tangy, but a bit samey as it goes on.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Sheep Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber with a reasonable head. Smells mostly of malt, and a little sweet. Lightly carbonated, with some mild hops. Very dry aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Choc Orange Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with creamy off-white white head. Smells bitter with some fruit notes. Not a huge amount of orange, but definite bitterness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Golden Sheep ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden/amber with a very small white head and a lot of bubbles of carbonation. Smells sweet with light malt and some grassy notes. Initially a bit sweet but quickly overtaken by bitter hops, and a dry, fruity finish. Easy drinking.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Imperial Russian Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with a reddish tinge. Looks like coke. Smells of rich, dark fruit with some alcohol notes. Some red wine notes; very much like port. Excellent.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Imperial Russian Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />This is a proper Imperial stout. Deep brown with a light brown head. Aroma is well balanced with bitterness, roast malt, some alcohol. Full bodied and a bit sticky. Starts a bit sweet and ends with a lingering bitterness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Monty Python’s Holy Grail ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Honey/copper/straw coloured. Not a whole lot of smell, perhaps some grassiness. Slightly sour, with a weird blue cheese saltiness. No real aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ram Tackle ★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a generic bitter with hints of smooth flow. OK.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sainsbury’s Yorkshire Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Bronze colour with a strong malt aroma. Taste also has lots of malt with some dry hops. Generic, and lacking a little in the hop department, but still drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Yorkshire Square Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber with a thin head. Smells sharp with grain notes. Taste is initially grass and lemon with bitter hops and then some pepperiness. Quite smooth and drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Blackhill</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Top Busty ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber in colour. Smells slightly like homebrew. Taste is quite bitter, and it certainly tastes darker than it looks.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Blackjack</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  First Deal ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber in colour. Smells of fruity, lemony hops. Taste is similar, quite full in the mouth with some citrus and sweetness, giving a slightly cheesecake like taste. Definite citrus in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Blindmans</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Beer Goggles ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks like a generic bitter. Tastes like a slightly hoppy generic bitter.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Blue Anchor</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Spingo Special ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Originally brewed to celebrate the marriage of Charles and Diana. Dark in colour. Smells earthy with some dark fruit. Taste is dominated by fruit and peppery hops, with some port. Finish is long with similar malt, fruit and hop flavours.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Boggart Hole Clough</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Blue For 2 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid-golden in colour with a frothy white head. Smells of hops and light malt. Tastes of biscuity malt with some citrus hops and a nice smoothness. No hop dryness in the finish, which is slightly disappointed. A little unexciting, but still very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Rum Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark black with a small tan, frothy head. Smells sweet like rum truffle chocolates (expensive ones). Very smooth with some roasted flavour and a sweetness like liquer chocolates. A nice porter which for once isn’t overpowered by the rum.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Born in the Borders</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Elderflower ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale with bubbly white head. Smells very weird. Tastes of elderflower. Quite sweet and sticky with a bitter and malty finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Game Bird ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with virtually no head. Malty with some fruit in the aroma. Quite thin. Dominated by sweet malt and fruitiness. Pretty unremarkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Holy Cow ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Bronze in colour with frothy white head that leaves good lacing. Not a huge about of aroma. Tastes predominantly bitter with some spice in the finish. Pretty generic chestnut bitter.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Boston Beer Company</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Infinium ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, lots of fine bubbles and a fizzy white head. Smells quite like salt and vinegar crisps, with some yeast and marmite notes. Also some alcohol and sugary sweetness. Quite complex tasting, but nothing really distinct, maybe some apple and spice. Nice and clean in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Samuel Adams Boston Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light amber with a rocky head. Smells sweet with some floral hops. Tastes similar, with some caramel and a slightly spicy hoppy finish. Could do with more malt and less grain flavour.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Boundary</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Gift 1 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark black with tan head that disappears quite quickly. Roasted aroma with some alcohol and maybe spice notes. Quite a tingly mouthfeel. Definite alcohol along with some sweetness and a background of roasted malt. Aftertaste of alcohol and roasted flavours.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Boundary Road</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  American Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with white head. Smells and tastes of citrus hops, with a very crisp finish and a lingering dryness that is well balanced by the fruit.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Arabica Dabra ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with tan head. Definite aroma and taste of coffee. Roast malt as well. A little too bitter, especially in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Flying Fortress ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden. Loads of malt and bittersweet happiness in the taste. Like an ESB, especially the caramel sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Jack The Sipper ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Nearly black with bubbly off-white head. Smells of chocolate and coffee. Roasted malt, sweetness and chocolate aftertaste combine with a tingly mouthfeel to make a very drinkable London porter.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  The Chosen One ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small white head. Not much aroma. Quite sweet with a little malt but not much else going on. At least it’s not too fizzy.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bowmans</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Eldorado ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with elderflower. Tastes somewhat fruity but not too sweet. Well rounded. Probably a good summer beer. Has a looooooong aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Nutz ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with French chestnuts. Chestnut colour, with chestnut aromas and does actually taste of nuts, which is a pleasant surprise. Don’t think you’d want more than one of these in a session though.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Box Steam</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Derail Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper with a finger of white foamy head. Very little aroma. Some slight fizz in the mouthfeel. A little malt and a drying hop finish. Drinkable but a bit watery.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Steam Porter ★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with red hues and a tan head. Lots of roast coffee aroma. Creamy mouthfeel with some smoke, but nowhere near as much taste as you’d expect from a porter. May have been served too cold.</p>

  <span class="beers_abv">4.2%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">Brown Ale</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />Chestnut brown with an caramel aroma. Caramel in the mouth as well, some roast malts, but not enough to combat the sweetness. Roast finish,</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Farmer’s Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a foamy white head. Smells of roasted malt and oats. Tastes similar, with dryness from the malt and a smoothness from the oats. A lingering roast finish makes this a very drinkable stout.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brakspear</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Brakspear Bitter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />A bitter that genuinely lives up to its name, it is very bitter. A hint of malt, in both aroma and taste, provides some balance. I’d enjoy it as a session beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Brakspear Tripel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish brown with a thin head. Smells of toffee, malts and some dark fruit. There’s a definite alcohol smell. Nice crisp carbonation, tastes of roasted malts and alcohol, with a slight sweetness. Makes very good batter.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Oxford Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden colour, clear with a thick finger of head with good lacing. Smell is sweet and hoppy, taste is similar, although it only has a mild bitterness. Very drinkable and well balanced, lacking some excitement though.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Branscombe Vale</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  Cuvée Meilleurs Voeux ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy brown with a small, slightly off-white head, which leaves some lacing. Smells of alcohol with sweet, dark fruit. Some caramel and burnt malt in the taste. Too sweet and doesn’t really do enough.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  La Mac Vertus ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark and opaque. Slightly off-white, creamy head. Smells of dark fruit and roasted malt. Surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. Initially sweet with a roasted, almost burnt finish. Quite dry and surprisingly rich, full and stouty for a Belgian stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  La Mère Vertus ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very hazy with a small froth of white head. Smells sweet and fruity with pineapple candy notes. Some malty notes as well. Strong and malty taste, and nowhere near as sweet as you expect from the aroma. Some wheat notes and a little fizz in the mouth. Definite yeast as well. Probably too strong and definitely not subtle.</p>

  Cantillon Gueuze Lambic ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with good carbonation and a fizzy head when disturbed. Smells yeasty and slightly, but not too, sour. Very clean, with a nice level of grapefruit sourness. Very well balanced and packed with flavour. The benchmark gueuze.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Cantillon Iris ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very hazy dark golden. Smells slightly sour with Belgian yeast notes. Quite a sour taste, but very well-balanced with sourness and fruit sweetness. An excellent, complex, wheat-free Lambic.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Mamouche ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very hazy light golden. Definitely smells like a gueuze/lambic with lots of yeasty funk and sourness. Taste is very intense, with dry cider notes. Really cleverly balanced sourness, with elderflower notes and some tannins. This is a seriously excellent beer. The taste hits you even before it gets to your mouth.</p>

  <br />Golden, slightly hazy with a small, bubbly white head that leaves good lacing. Huge amount of aroma, with lots of tropical fruits. Some fizz in the mouth but quite smooth. Taste is fruity with a sweet aftertaste, some alcohol and spice (pepper) in the finish. Flavour is much more rounded than the aroma. Like marmalade on brown toast.</p>

  Forestinne Nordika ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very slight haze to the golden colour with white bubbles of head around the sides of the glass. Smells of orange with nutmeg, aniseed and cinnamon. Taste is similar; lightly spiced with some orange and a menthol-like finish. Quite thin and a bit weird.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Medium brown, with some haziness and a very large white head. Variable lacing. Smells of alcohol and some dark fruits, has a port-like quality. Fairly fizzy mouthfeel, with some sweetness and noticeable alcohol. Very drinkable, but certainly not a session beer!</p>

  Troublette ★★★★
  </span>

  3 Monts ★★
  </span>
  <br />Cork makes a satisfying pop. Clear, light golden with fine streams of carbonation and a large, rocky white head. Smells of bready malts.

  <br />Orange-brown, hazy, with a small white head. Some citrus (orange) in the nose along with some alcohol. Not a huge amount of aroma. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is slightly sweet, with orange and then a little sourness and a crisp, dry finish. Pretty boring.</p>

  Prestige ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Fizzy, copper coloured (almost orange), with a tan head. Smells quite like a gueuze, with the associated sourness. Tastes alcoholic (unsurprisingly) withs some dark fruit and a little sticky sweetness. Some hop bitterness balances it out. Very nice, and definitely a sipping beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Biolégère ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden in colour. Smells malty and slightly fruity. Taste is very surprising with a lot going on. Malt and yeast with some apple-like fruit and honey sweetness. Manages to stay quite light, like a light Duvel. Would be a good lunchtime tipple.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bons Voeux ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear and golden, with a vanishing white head with good lacing. Smells of fruit, bitter malt and some hops. Light and crisp, with some alcohol notes and a little fruit. Like good champagne.

  Hercule Stout ★★★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Quintine Blanche Bio ★★★★
  </span>

  <br />Pale cloudy yellow with a smallish white head. Smells slightly tart, with a weissbier-like yeastiness. Quite fizzy, but with a well rounded taste. Some citrus hoppiness with a little apple and some lagery notes. Not what I was expecting, a bit too fizzy and sweet to be great.</p>

  Pietra ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Chestnut in colour with a small slightly off-white head. Smells of malt and chestnut (contains chestnut flour). Somewhat fizzy mouthfeel, with a taste dominated by malt and nuttiness.

  Page 24 A La Rhubarbe ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with real rhubarb juice. Clear golden with a small white froth around the edge of the glass. Light aroma of rhubarb and some alcohol notes. Tingly mouthfeel. An initial tartness leads to a drying aftertaste. Not sour, but similar in spirit to a gueuze. Quite refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Page 24 Réserve Hildegarde Blonde ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy orange with plenty of carbonation and a rapidly-vanishing white head. Smells like a Belgian Blond with citrus (orange/lemon) and hops in the aroma.

  Houblon Dobbelen IPA Tripel ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy straw with a large, frothy white head. Some streams of carbonation. Smells of citrus hops with some yeast. Bitter upfront, crisp, with a sweet malt smoothness in the middle. Finish is alcohol and tropical fruit, then dryness, which lasts for ages. A little too fizzy on the tongue, but otherwise great.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  La Chouffe ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Bright golden colour with a slight haze and a large white head. Not a huge amount of aroma through the head, possibly some lemon. Slightly sweet but complicated, with a spiciness and some tartness. Not too much carbonation, very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

  McChouffe ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with some ruby hints. Well carbonated. Aroma is predominantly candy sugar, with a little hops. Surprisingly light taste, some caramel and perhaps a little roasted malt, quite subtle really. Doesn’t seem like it’s 8%.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  N’Ice Chouffe ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid-brown with tan head. Smells of light caramel and malt. Tastes similar, with good spicing; cloves, cinnamon and other mulling spices. Also distinct alcohol notes. Fairly sweet with dark fruit. Nicely complex.</p>

  <br />Dark, hazy brown with a tan head with lots of foam. Sweet smell, Belgian candy sugar with some malts. Taste starts sweet, with caramel turning into malt and a warming alcohol feel, then some spicy hops. Thick and oily and a little too alcoholic.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Rochefort 6 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Probably the best of the Rochefort. Dark brown in colour with an almost-white foam. Aroma is biscuity malt with a little citrus, very intense. Much less sweet than the other two Rochefort, with a smoother mouthful. Mellow taste, with bread and malt with a sweetish finish.</p>

  Rochefort 8 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy dark ruby colour, with a foamy tan head and a little lacing. Smells of dried fruits and roasted malts, with some alcohol notes. Tastes similar to the smell, with some sweet caramel. Quite drinkable, but one to savour rather than quaff.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Maisel’s Weisse Original ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep yellow with a couple of fingers of white head, which leads some lacing. Smells of banana and bubblegum. Taste is quite light and along the same lines as the smell. Also a little spiciness. A little thinner than I was expecting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Göller Brotzeit Seidla ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale with a frothy white head. Smells of sweet malt. Some fizz in the mouth. Very clean with light malt and a little sweetness. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brauerei Heller</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hellers Kölsch ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale yellow with a small, rapidly-vanishing head. Light aroma with bready malt. Nothing complicated in the flavour, although there’s more going on than I expected from a Kölsch – some decent hopping and grain notes. Not bad for a style I’m generally unimpressed by.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brauerei Im Fuchschen</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Im Füchschen Alt ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep copper, completely clear with a dense head. Smells of sweet malts with some hops. Taste is slightly sweeter, perhaps with some nuttiness. Well hopped with a dry finish. One of the most drinkable beers I’ve ever had.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brauerei Schumacher</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Schumacher Alt ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear, orangey copper with a thick, slightly off-white head, which is long-lasting. Smell is a mix of hops and sweet, roasted malts. Taste is similar, but perhaps with a little spice. Has more body than the other alts, so less quaffable but very nice, with a little more flavour.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brauerei Weihenstephan</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with a large white head. Banana and spice in the aroma. Taste is also banana, with some citrus. Lots of fizz on the palate, but still nicely drinkable. Actually quite filling.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale straw colour. Smells slightly lemony with yeast and some spice. Bubbly mouthfeel with plenty of malt and some crisp lemon leading to banana notes. A nice, refreshing weissbier.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Weihenstephaner Original ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Crystal clear yellow with a large, sticky head. Smells of light grain, with musty grass notes. Smooth mouthfeel with good, light hop bitterness and clean malt. Nothing different to a good helles, but then again, this is a good helles.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Weihenstephaner Vitus ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Murky, orange/yellow colour with large white head. Smells slightly lemony with yeast and some spice. Tastes slightly musty/hayey with some banana and caramel. Well carbonated. Very nice example of a Weisenbock.</p>

  Ysbrid y Ddraig ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep golden in colour. Matured in whisky casks, which you can certainly taste and smell. Similar to Innis and Gunn but with more hops.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  07|03 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with no real head. Does indeed smell of elderflower and lime. Quite fizzy. Definite elderflower and lime in the taste as well. Slightly spicy finish. Wouldn’t know it’s a beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brew Moon</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Luna Wit ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with patchy white head.  Smells of lemon and spices. Tastes like a wit with yeast and citrus. Nicely balanced. Very clean and drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brew York</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  X-Panda V1 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Officially a session IPA. Clear orange with a good head. Aroma of malt with some sweetness and obvious hop notes. Flavour is medium in pretty much everything.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">BrewDog</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  0.5% Coffee Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Low alcohol. Jet black with a tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and definite coffee. Taste is rich coffee with a decent amount of fizz. It’s a bit thin and really just coffee, but I could drink this all day.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  5am Saint ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber/chestnut with patches of bubbly white head. Some resin hop aroma. Tastes slightly burnt, very savoury with soy sauce like notes. Some dryness in the finish, but overall it’s just odd.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  77 Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells a little lagery, but with more malt than you’d expect. Slightly sour with a hoppy bitterness. Quite like a light IPA.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Alice Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Ruby red, smells slightly fruity. Taste dark and fruity with some burnt notes. OK, but not as smooth as some porters, and not really interesting enough for the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Alice Porter (5.2%) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours black with a small tan head. Smells of roast, dark malt. Smooth mouthfeel with little carbonation. Dominated by red fruit, sweetness and a slightly bitter, lingering finish. OK, but a bit middle of the road.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Avery Brown Dredge ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a very small white head. Light malt with some hops, but less than I was expecting. Lots of alcohol notes as well. Massive amounts of taste, mostly bitter hops, grapefruit and a little sweetness. Also some skunk notes, with biscuity malt - it’s got almost everything you could ask for in a light beer. Finish is dry with a smooth hop bitterness with resin notes and a small amount of interesting. Very good, but perhaps there’s too much going on.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bitch Please ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with red hints and very little head. Smells strong with roasted and smoked notes. Pretty smokey taste. Quite like Tactical Nuclear Penguin watered down to a slightly more sensible ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bounty Hunter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with a beige head. Aroma of chocolate and coconut. Very drinkable, quite rich with more chocolate and coconut. Not too much carbonation. Bittersweet finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Brixton Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with tan head that leaves good lacing. Some dark fruit along with rich malt in the aroma. Taste is well rounded with chocolate, coffee and some fruit bitterness. Nice lingering bitter finish. A very nice porter.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Campfire Cult ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A bit of a weird one - a sour stout. Black with virtually no head. Smell is a mix of roasted stout aromas and sourness. Bitterness first, leads into roasted notes and a slightly weird finish. Interesting to try.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Choco Libre ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with small ring of tan head. Loads of coffee, chocolate and dark, roasted malt in the aroma. Very full mouthfeel with a good bitterness and plenty of roasted flavours. A very nice Imperial stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Cocoa Psycho ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a tan head. Smells lightly of cocoa. Rich and smooth with chocolate notes and some bitterness. Nice, lingering bitter finish. Very nice, but definitely a sipping winter beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Cult Lager ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very drinkable lager, similar in style to good German Helles. Strong kick of hops may not appeal to fans of generic UK lagers.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dead Pony Club ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden. Smells strongly of American hops with a good mix of resin, fruit and dryness. Taste is an explosion of hops, well-balanced and not too harsh or bitter. Clean start, leading to a hoppy finish. Good American-style pale ale.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dogma ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with no head. Apparently contains heather and honey. Some dark, sweet spiciness in the nose. Slight tingle, with spice and dry bitterness with sour notes in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  East of Vermont ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Yellow with very small head. Looks quite a lot like mango juice. Definite soft fruit (peach and mango) in the aroma. Some follows through into the taste, along with plenty of hop bitterness and resin notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Electric India ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with quickly-vanishing white head. Orange and spice in the aroma. Loads of flavour with citrus hops and some spice. Also a sweetness leading to a peppery and bitter finish. Very interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Elvis Juice ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish orange brown with bubbly white head. Smells of resinous hops. Definite grapefruit notes at the start leading  to a slightly bitter finish with fruit sweetness. Very good.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fake Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with small white head. Smells and tastes lagery, bit more in the good German style.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fake Lager with nectarines ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small white head. Odd mix of grain and fruitiness in the aroma. Definite nectarine in the flavour. Dominates the beer flavour. Nice. Perhaps a bit too fruity.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Hardcore IPA ★
  </span>
  <span class="beers_abv">9.0%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">IPA</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />Light, golden colour, with a strong aroma of alcohol and fruit. Reminds me of a barley wine. Tastes almost entirely of alcohol, followed by a dry, lingering, unpleasant aftertaste. Not a patch on their Punk IPA.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hazy AF ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with floral hops and tropical fruit in the aroma. Light and refreshing with a medium carbonation. Taste is citrus and tropical fruits. A very decent low alcohol beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hazy Jane ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden, as the name would suggest. Aroma has lots of tropical fruit good. Thin white head rapidly vanishes. Taste has some malt, but dominated by citrus (grapefruit) and US-style hops. Very drinkable, worryingly so given the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hella Helles ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with tight, almost creamy, white head. Grass and grain notes that you’d expect from a Helles. Taste is also as you’d expect, with some sweet malt and a light bitterness in the finish. Certainly competes with a standard German Helles.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hoppy Christmas ★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a strong, highly-hopped American-style IPA. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s not amazing either.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  IPA is Dead - Exp 366 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with very little head. Single hop IPA. Resin hop aroma. Taste has resin, pine and grapefruit with a very lingering bitterness. Some tropical fruit? Very drinkable and interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  IPA is dead amarillo ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small white head. Some hop aroma. Clean and worryingly drinkable, although nothing to write home about.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Indie Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Not a huge amount of aroma. Maybe some citrus. Not a lot going on in the taste department either.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Instamatic ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A white IPA, whatever that means. Hazy golden with a large white head that fades to bubbles. Not a huge amount of aroma, maybe some lemon notes. Taste is quite thin. Some bitterness, with a smooth mouthfeel. Clean and refreshing, but unexciting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  International Arms Race ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a small white head that gives good lacing when swirled. Smells of ginger and sweetness. Doesn’t taste anywhere near as sweet as it smells. Light spicing with ginger and some orange bitterness in the finish. Taste is much better than the aroma. A nice take on a hop-free beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Jack Hammer ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with no head. Loads of resinous and bitter hops in the aroma. Quite tingly. Definitely dominated by hops, especially resin and bitterness. Pretty good, and very unsubtle.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Jet Black Heart ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells like a slightly sweet stout. Pretty rich with not a lot of fizz, some roasted malt, sweetness and light chocolate notes. Also a touch of bitterness. It’s basically what you’d expect from a milk stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Libertine Black Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a small white head. Aroma has alcohol, cherry, some resin/dry hops and grapefruit pith. Tastes like a black IPA with hop notes, resin, roasted malt and a touch of disappointment.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Magic Stone Dog ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with Stone and Magic Rock. Pale golden with very little head. Clean and crisp with a bitter spicy hop finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mistletoe Mafia ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Apparently a festive Vienna lager. Clear dark golden with frothy white head. Aroma and taste are dominated by sweet malt. Quite a lot of biscuit flavour and not a lot else.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Nanny State ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed in response to media criticism of BrewDog’s recent high percentage beers. Smells of raw hops, with an initial hop blast, folowed by a long malt-heavy, somewhat sweet finish. Surprisingly dark, with a good head. Develops an increasingly hoppy aftertaste. Other than tasting slightly unfinished, you’d never know this was so weak.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Native Son ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Double IPA. Slightly hazy dark golden/orange, with small white head. Some hops in the aroma, but not as much as I expected. Same in the taste, although there is a long, bitter finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Paradox Longrow ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of whisky and roasted malts with a sweetness akin to other stouts. Pours very black with a thin white head. Tastes of malts with some chocolate and a slight sweetness. Some slight whisky notes, but not overpowering. Nice warming alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Punk AF ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale yellow gold with small, bubbly white head and streams of large bubbles. Tropical fruit aroma. Very clean and light with some sharpness in the finish and quite a spritzy mouthfeel. Very nice alcohol free beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Punk IPA ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells strongly of hops, also slightly floral. Very hoppy, slightly resinous taste. Aftertaste is long-lasting, with dry hops, but also refreshing. The taste develops through the bottle, becoming more complex. Worryingly drinkable, especially considering the percentage.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Quench Quake ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with no real head. As expected, the aroma is fruity and sour. Taste has plenty of citrus, with tangerine/orange and maybe grapefruit. It’s essentially alcoholic fruit juice, and none the worse for it. Fun and interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Raspberry Blitz ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Low alcohol. Pink with a white foam. Taste and aroma are both tart raspberry with some sweetness. Very drinkable and balanced. Perhaps a little thin, but otherwise very nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Slot Machine ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Red rye IPA. Dark red with frothy and sticky off-white head. Aroma has citrus and some sweetness, as well as rye notes. Plenty of hops with dry, resin dominating. Finish is quite spicy with a lingering, dry bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Strawberry Blitz ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very cloudy as pink - looks like pink grapefruit juice. Definite aroma of strawberries. Taste is initially a little strawberry with a sourness in the finish, but not too harsh. Berliner Weiss style.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Tactical Nuclear Penguin ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />[Shared, poured into small glasses – yes, it really is 32%] Very dark, no head or carbonation, Smells of stout, smoke and alcohol. Tastes very similar to a smokey whisky, with a little sweetness. Some peat and slightly burnt notes. Complicated, and definitely not a quaffing beer. Would be a pretty decent whisky.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Vagabond ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Gluten free! Load’s loads tropical fruit fruit hops. Tastes of passion fruit and pineapple. Good hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Zombie Cake ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with definite red hints and a lacy off-white head. Sweet and roasted aroma. Quite a full mouthfeel with sweetness and some vanilla and chocolate notes. Smooth and very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">BrewDog (Tesco)</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  American Double IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper in colour, smells very hoppy (as it should). Very tingly hops, some grassiness and definite alcohol notes. Hops are flowery and fruity with some spice notes. Very drinkable, worryingly so given the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brewers &amp; Union</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Beast of the Deep ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden amber with a white head. Smells quite sweet with caramel notes. An OK beer, with some syrupy notes; could do with some more bitterness to combat the sweetness and alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brewery Budweiser Budvar</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Budvar Dark Lager ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown, almost black with a small off-white head. Smells of roasted malts, much like a dark mild. Nicely rounded and crisp, mostly malt with some faint hops and a little sweetness. More like a mild than a standard dark lager, i.e. heavier and fuller.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brewsters</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Stilton Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a small, off-white head. Smells of roasted malt and dark fruits. Flavour is similar, no detectable stilton, but it’s a very nice stout.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Bristol Beer Factory</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Acer ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with bubbly white head. Citrus hop aroma. Loads of hops in the taste with citrus and bitterness. Excellent session beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Blackcurrant and Licquourice ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with a tan head. Don’t get either of the flavours in the aroma. Maybe a touch of fruit in the taste, along with some sourness in the finish. A bit disappointing.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bristol Hefe ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy orange with frothy head. Smells of yeast, with a bubblegum sweetness along with pineapple and mango. Tastes quite sweet with banana and yeast. Leads to a bitter, dry and fruity finish. Not as good as many German weisses.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bristol Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slight red tinge with very little head. Some roasted malts in the aroma. Quite light and fizzy with some dry roasted notes which linger well.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Chilli Chocolate Stout ★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells more chocolatey than the standard chocolate stout, but there’s no chilli that I can find at all. There’s some tingle, but that could just be the fizz. Again, bitter in the finish. Not bad, but disappointing.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Chocolate Orange Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of bitter orange. Tastes like orange chocolate, but more the former than the latter. Again, quite a thin stout with a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Chocolate Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells slightly sweet. Tastes a bit chocolatey, but more like cocoa powder than proper chocolate. Really all the chocolate does is add a bitterness to it.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Creme Brulee ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Aged in rum casks. Dark with a tan head. Definite alcohol notes in the aroma. Mostly rum in the mouth, with no real vanilla or sweetness. Not really what it says on the bottle, but a nice rum cask stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Exhibition ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown, almost black with no head. Smells of dark fruit. Not too fizzy in the mouth, with some roasted malt and cocoa notes. Could do being a bit more exciting to justify the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fortitude ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with tight, frothy white head. It’s a generic bitter with some slightly sweet malt and light fruity notes and bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Glenlivet Cask Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks similar to the Laphroaig stout. Tastes a lot like Glenlivet. Again, a very nice beer, but not as nice a whisky cask. Much lighter and appealed to a wider range of people. Develops an almost sweet flavour.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a large, frothy white head. Aroma is citrus hops with a little malt. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel with a weird astringent dryness. On the plus side, this makes it quite refreshing. Not bad overall.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Hazelnut Latte Stout ★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of roast coffee. Tastes like watery coffee with a strange bitterness in the finish. Also some sweetness in the aftertaste with a slight stickiness. Reminds me of tia maria.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Imperial Bourbon ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with a dark brown head. Smells slightly bourbony. Very smooth with definite bourbon notes in the finish. Perhaps a bit rich, but a nice sharing beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Imperial Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with a slightly oily look to the surface. Smells of roasted may. Very smooth with alcohol notes and a lovely, full, rounded mouthfeel. Nicely complex with some dark fruit and brandy/port-like alcohol.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Imperial Whisky ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with a dark brown head. Definite Speyside notes in the aroma. Very nice; must be done with a good Speyside. Tastes exactly how you’d expect. Maybe not quite as nice as the Laphroag cask though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Independence ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with frothy white head. Loads of hop aroma, mostly tropical fruit. Taste is similar with loads of dry, fruity, tropical hops. Packs a real punch. Excellent beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Laphroaig Cask Stout ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Definite whisky aroma with some smokiness. No real head. Tastes like Laphroaig with plenty of peaty smoke. Bang on. Like a less alcoholic (and nicer) version of Tactical Nuclear Penguin. Very nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Milk Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells slightly sweet, but not a lot else going on. Also quite fizzy with with an additional creaminess leading to a smooth finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mocha ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with a tan head. Unsurprisingly smells of mocha with lots of coffee (like coffee cream sweets). Coffee at the start of the taste, leading to chocolate and then back into a coffee aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Number 7 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale copper and smells more roasted than you’d expect from the colour. Long, lingering dryness with a bit of malt and some greenness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Port ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with a tan head. Some port aroma. Also port notes in the aftertaste, which overpowers any sweet or roasted notes there may have been in the original stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Raspberry Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of raspberry but in a synthetic way. Initial taste is in fact raspberry with good sourness, but then leads to a syrupy sweetness reminiscent of cough medicine.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Smoked Chilli and Chipotle ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with a tan head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some pepperiness and a hint of building chilli heat in the finish. Would definitely be worth trying a whole pint.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Southville Hop ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very hazy, dark golden in colour with a small lacy white head. Smells strongly of tropical fruits, mango and passionfruit. Surprisingly clean-tasting, some fizz with a bit of sherbet and plenty of fruity hops.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ultimate Raspberry ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with not a lot of head. Some berry notes in the aroma. Definite raspberry in the taste. Genuinely like a mix of stout and raspberry beer, which may or may not appeal.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Ultimate Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Not a lot of aroma, but a much fuller mouthfeel than the previous stouts. Some fizz and definite alcohol notes coming through. Has a lingering warmth and a slight dryness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Vanilla Milk Stout ★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells very similar to the normal milk stout. However, there’s lots of vanilla and cream in the taste. Vanilla is overpowering, but some people really liked it. Tastes like a vanilla stout float.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  West Coast Red ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish brown with a very small off-white head. Smells of floral, resinous and bitter hops. Tastes similar. Well-rounded with roasted notes in the finish and some sweetness. Aftertaste is somewhat overpowering.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brodies</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Smoked Rye Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark black with a very small, off-white head. Light roasted coffee notes. Some creamy/milk aromas as well. Quite tingly in the mouth. Light, roasted malt and some hoppiness. A bit dull, but very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brooklyn Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Chocolate Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Opaque black colour, with a quickly-vanishing head. Some chocolate and coffee aroma and some alcohol notes. Very roasted taste, if there’s any chocolate taste it’s bitter dark chocolate. Slightly bitter with some alcohol.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Brooklyn Brown Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown, with a good head, which disappears quickly. Smells strongly of malt, and is a little fizzy on the tongue. Initially tastes ‘dark’, roasted malts with chocolate/coffee undertones. No real lingering aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Brooklyn Lager ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber coloured, although I drank the second one out the bottle. A very well-balanced lager with enough hops and malt; the floral hops keep it refreshing and interesting. Not too fizzy.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  East India Pale Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Variable head (at the beer tasting), with medium carbonation. Copper coloured with little aroma. Quite dry and hoppy, as you’d expect from an IPA. Unpleasant dry, almost astringent aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Insulated ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Guessing that this is a take on a German Dunkel (I drank it with a German, anyway). Very dark with tight and large off-white head. Roasted and almost nutty aroma. Taste is light and drinkable, whilst still being complex enough to keep it interesting. Would like to try again.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Local 1 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />pale golden with some streams of carbonation. Small finger of white head. Hops and soft fruit (banana/pineapple) in the smell, along with some candy sugar. Quite fizzy mouthfeel, with alcoholic notes, some pepper and a slightly metallic taste. Dry finish, but a bit sticky.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Local 2 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Darkish brown with a tan head. Bittersweet aroma. Some malt and roasted notes. Pretty standard, and not really worth the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Scorcher IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small white froth. Lemon/citrus aroma. Taste is grapefruit/lemon bitterness with quite a sweet finish. More of a pale ale than an IPA. Generic but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Broughton</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  6.2 IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Does what it says on the bottle. It’s a strong and hoppy IPA. Chestnut brown with citrus aroma. Lots of hops with dry, resinous notes mixed with fruitiness. Quite complex.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Lots of citrus (lemon) aroma. Clean and crisp. It’s a very drinkable and somewhat interesting lager. Also has some sweet caramel notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Greenmantle Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark mahogany with a tight, very slightly off-white head. Smells sweet with caramel and roasted nuts. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel, and also quite thin. Some bitterness, but not a lot else. Nothing wrong with it though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Hopopotamus ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Loads of dry hop aroma with fruitiness. Certainly doesn’t hold back. Dry and bitter with a big punch of hops. Fruity notes develop and then a lingering, dry finish. One for the hop lovers.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Merlin’s Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with tight white head. Some hops in the aroma and taste. Generally very drinkable but nothing special.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Proper IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep gold with loads of citrus in the aroma. Quite fizzy with plenty of citrus and sharp hops dominating the taste. Lingering, quite bitter finish. Not subtle, but very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Sin Bin Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with rocky white head. Smells a bit sour. Lots of bitterness with occasional fruit notes. Distinctly average.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Petrus Aged Pale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden. Smells surprisingly sour. Taste is similar, like a light Flanders red or gueuze. Dry finish. Definitely one to be savoured rather than quaffed.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Pilaarbijter Bruin ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with tan head. Smells sweet, a bit like coke. Very well rounded and drinkable, with some roasted sweetness. Clean and somewhat refreshing.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Pilaarbijter Tripel Blonde ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden. Tight bubbles of white head that calm down after a while. Grain aroma, almost sour notes. Sweet, fizzy and metallic with an odd aftertaste, especially on the roof of the mouth. Has the feeling of bad real cider.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Bocker</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bellegems Bruin ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish-brown with a small, off-white head. Smells sour. Tastes similar, although perhaps it’s a bit out of balance even for something trying to be sour. A blend of Flanders Ould Bruin and an 18 month old lambic.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Bellegems Witbier ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy yellow with a small, white head. Smells like a lemony witbier. Smooth with a slight tingle in the mouth. Quite full wheat mouthfeel, cut through by lemon citrus. Very drinkable with a nice, lingering finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Boon</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Boon Oude Geuze ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a thick head. Carbonated like Champagne. Smell is mostly floral, with some apple. Moderately sour tat, with a little spice. Nicely balanced, not too tart. Quite fizzy on the tongue. Very complex and moreish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Horals Oude Gueuze Mega Blend ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden in colour, with a tight white head. Smells like you’d expect from a gueuze, with lemon, light vinegar and some mild funk notes. Taste is similar, and this gueuze isn’t too sour, well balanced but not a huge amount of complexity. Tea notes keep it interesting. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Bosteels</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bosteel Dubbel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mahogany with tight bubbles of white head. Sugar, alcohol and orange notes in the aroma. Lots of fizz in the mouth, but quite clean with spice and alcohol. Also some dark sugar. Lingering, spicy finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Deus ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden, small bubbles of carbonation with a relatively large head of tiny white bubbles. Some alcohol notes with floweriness in the aroma. Clean initial taste with a definite tingle on the tongue. Hops and a little sweetness with an alcohol undertone. Almost wine-like at times. Very nice, but also very expensive.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Pauwel Kwak ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy orange with a decent head. Some cirrus aroma. Quite gassy, with a malt taste and a slightly sour finish. Slightly too sweet but there is at least a balancing dryness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Tripel Karmeliet ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy pale amber, thin white lacing. Honey and malt in the aroma. Mouthfeel is prickly. Some fruit and a mild spiciness, some malts. Alcohol gets more noticeable towards the end. Could do with a litte more taste to balance the ABV, but very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Corsendonk</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Corsendonk Agnus ★★★★
  </span>

  <span class="beers_style">Spiced Beer</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />Reddish-brown with large foamy white head. Smells strong. Some alcohol burn and sweet malts in the flavour. Other than that, it’s very bland with a massive sweet hit in the finish, along with more alcohol.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Corsendonk Dubbel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with red hues and a very tight slightly off-white head. Toasted, slightly burt aroma with some dark fruit. Fizzes to extra head in the mouth. Quite rich with dark fruit and alcohol dominating.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Helleketelbier ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with a fine white head. Slight sour notes with some fruit and sweetness. Also an odd dirty-dishwater overtone. Taste is caramelized sugar and dirtyiness. Lots of alcohol and some sweet fruit. A weird sourness means it’s a bit bland but remarkably offensive at the same time.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

  Satan Gold ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden, a few streams of bubbles. Bottle conditioned. Creamy, white head. Aroma is reminiscent of champagne. Very fizzy. Taste is biscuity malt, with some fruit in the finish. Nice, dry, slightly chalky finish. The bottom of the bottle is slightly sweeter and fuller in flavour. Everyone liked this.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Satan Red ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden beer with a small white head. Smells of bitter hops with some dryness and perhaps a little fruit. Some carbonation in the mouth. Sweet malts and a strange lingering finish. A little spice and burnt sugar turning to slightly-too-strong alcohol.</p>

  <br />Tight, small white head, which is quite bubbly. Copper, hazy with a little carbonation. Smells sweet and strong. Big alcohol kick in the taste, sweet with a long alcohol burn. Perhaps some sour fruit, with some dryness in the aftertaste. Much too strong.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Oerbier ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddy brown with a tan head. Caramel, malt and dark fruit. Maybe a little sweetness. Taste is very strong alcohol, which almost reaches a burn. A large amount of fizz ans some sourness, like a very alcoholic Flemish bruin. Also some burnt malt notes after a while.</p>

  Malheur 10° ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy yellow with a couple of fingers of white head. Smells sweet, with citrus and alcohol cutting through. Tastes sweet and alcoholic, maybe some fruit but it’s hard to pick out. Full mouthed. It’s quite drinkable, take it slow though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Malheur 12° ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown, almost black with a frothy head. Smells strongly of roasted malts, quite bitter with an alcohol undertone. Definitely a potent beer. Much more roasted than most quadruples, and very easy to drink given the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Malheur 6° ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden, slightly hazy with a tight white head. A few bubbles of carbonation. Smells weissbier-like with citrus and some spices. Also some soap notes. Quite gassy and doesn’t taste of a whole lot. Some breadiness and an alcohol twang. Really not very exciting and the tinglyness overpowers any taste there is.</p>

  Hop Harvest 2012 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy, light golden with large, tight bubbles of white head. Smells quite like a wit with some soapiness. Very smooth with bitterness in the finish. A good wit-like beer but not exciting enough to rave about, especially as it’s a bit soapy.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Noir de Dottignies ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a tan head. Some roasted malts in the aroma, with dark fruit (raisins), coffee ground and hop bitterness. Smells quite strong. Tingly mouthfeel, gassy like an imperial stout. Very nice, with plenty of malt (apparently 6 types) balanced by hop dryness and a little fruit.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Delirium Nocturnum ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark ruby with a tan head. Smells almost medicinal, with some caramel and alcohol. Surprisingly creamy with malts and some caramel. Has a little spice with some warming alcohol notes. Quite complex, with a drying aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Delirium Red ★★
  </span>
  <br />Red/purple brown with a small slick of white head. Definite cherry aroma. Dry and slightly sour with a drying finish and some chalkiness. Taste is cough drop cherry. Sweetness builds slowly but overpowered by a bitter finish reminiscent of cherry stones.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Delirium Tremens ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Yellow, with a large foamy white head. Smells spicy with some apricot or other soft fruit. Medium bodied, with pale malts and fruitiness. Some honey sweetness accompanies the alcohol. However, this is really all about the spices. This could get you very drunk, very quickly.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Huyghe Tripel ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a white head that leaves good lacing. Smells of alcohol, yeast and some spicing. Very smooth in the mouth, although it’s quite flat. Weirdly a bit like a flat hefeweiss. Taste is quite sweet with fruit and a little spicing. Leads to a lingering, dry finish with some banana notes. Too sweet for me.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  La Guillotine ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Quite pale, slightly hazy, with a long-lasting white head. Slight citrus nose, with a touch of sweet malts. Fizzy on the tongue, some lemony citrys and a dryness from the hops. There’s a kick of alcohol, but it’s well disguised by the other flavours and they dry aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Kerkom</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bink Blond ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slight haze to the golden colour. Smells quite sweet. A bit of fizz in the mouth. Not too exciting, there’s some alcohol and sweetness with a hint of clove and some light smoke notes. Finish is quite sticky.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Bink Bruin ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark malt with a reddish tinge. Lots of malt and dark fruit (raisins and dates). Quite sweet with some alcohol notes and a full mouthfeel.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Liefmans</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Goudenband ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Red-brown in colour, with a large, frothy tan head. Smells sour - very much like Rodenbach Grand Cru. Quite tart and sour, with an additional drying aftertaste. There’s also a little sweetness. Complex and interesting, but I still prefer the Grand Cru.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Kriek Foudroyante ★★
  </span>
  <br />Cherry red in colour with a slight foam of pinkish head. Smells like cherry drops. Sweetness from the cherry and sourness from the lambic. Surprisingly well balanced but some strange sherbet notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Lindemans Apple ★★
  </span>
  <br />Lots of head retention. Crisp and apply, although I wonder what the “natural” flavours they’ve added are, as it tastes like apple sweets. Couldn’t drink a lot of it, but it’s not as poor as I thought it was going to be.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Lindemans Cuvée René ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with lots of tiny bubbles and good white lacing. Smells musty, sour with some tartness and a little funk. Taste is similar, but not too much tartness. Lingering sourness in the finish. Very drinkable; would probably make a good introduction to gueuzes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Lindemans Faro Lambic ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells slightly sour and fruity. Dark tea coloured with no head. Not too fizzy. Nice mouthfeel, only slightly sour with a citrus aftertaste. Some sweetness and fruit in the finish. This is an incredibly interesting beer, which is very drinkable. Half of my bottle escaped to the other people in the room!</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Lindemans Gueuze ★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of sweet vinegar. Dark golden with very little head. Taste is oddly sweet/sour. Also some stickiness. Generally a bit odd, and not a great example of a gueuze.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lindemans Gueuze Lambic ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Highly carbonated, hazy dark amber. Smells dry, with a slight sourness and some yeast. Fizzy mouthfeel, but boy is this tart! A long drying tart finish. I like tart beers, but this perhaps takes it too far.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lindemans Tea Beer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden amber, some carbonation. Slightly cloudy with absolutely no head. Smells mostly of fruit, possibly cherries. Very tart - sour cherries. Tea very hard to pick out, you’d never get it unless you knew what it was. Some slight sweet stickiness. More like cider than tea. Quite drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pecheresse ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown colour with a little carbonation. Smells slightly of peach with a little sourness, so what you’d expect. Sweet peach dominates, with a (very) little dryness in the finish. Reminiscent of cider.</p>

  Hapkin ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Apparently a Duvel copy, but quite different. Slightly cloudy golden colour with a huge head. Nose is distinctively Belgian with candy sugar and some spice. Sweet and strong taste with yeast and citrus flavours. I got bored of it.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Wolf 8 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, pretty much black, with a very tight, white head. Dark, roasted malt and some bitterness in the aroma. Good lacing. Lots of fizz with roasted malt, liquorice, and some bitterness (hop-like) and cocoa dryness in the finish. Much better when it’s not as gassy, as then it’s very smooth and well-rounded.</p>

  Oude Gueuze ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy light golden with a tight, frothy white head. Must sourness - smells like a gueuze should. Prickly mouthfeel. Some sourness and sharpness in the taste, but not overpowering and not as strong as it smells.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Caractere Rouge ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Red with white head. Smells of cherries with some sourness. Tastes similar with a bit of sticky sweetness. Worryingly drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Rodenbach Classic (Red) ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Ruby coloured, with an initial sour cherry hit. Unlike the Grand Cru, the sourness fades after the initial hit. Enough maltiness/sweetness to keep it drinkable. A good introduction to sour beers.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Rodenbach Grand Cru ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark red with little head but a decent amount of lacing. Smells sweet and sour, with some fruity notes. Initial sourness isn’t overpowering, and is balanced by a slight sweetness, which makes it very well rounded. Despite the sourness, it’s actually very refreshing. Some carbonation, which works really well.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Roman</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Adrian Brouwer Dark Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Despite the name, its very dark, with ruby hues. Has a huge, frothy tan head which goes down to a finger pretty quickly. Some sweetness and alcohol on the nose. Very powerful taste. Fizz and alcohol hit you initially, followed by malt and dark fruit. A lot of fizz.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Black Hole ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very clear golden with a tight white head. Smells lagery with some sweetness. Taste is sweet and clean, and very thin. Slightly metallic in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Ename Tripel ★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, slightly hazy, some carbonation and frothy head. Candy sugar aroma, continuing into the initial taste. Honey and a chalky dryness. Quite high ABV and needs to do something more interesting for my money.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Witkap Livinus ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hay golden with very little head. Aroma has some hops, a little candy sugar and some alcohol. Fizzy mouthfeel. Taste has some spice, similar to a spiced rum. Tingly and lasting alcohol notes. Very full aftertaste, which is slightly metallic at the end.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Witkap Pater Tripel ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Blonde beer, quite cloudy and smells how you’d expect from a tripel, earthy, with a hint of citrus and sweetness. Actually, the smell is hard to define. Smooth, not too fizzy, and very well rounded. Not much of an aftertaste, and worryingly drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Slappmutske</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Slaapmutske Blond ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, slightly hazy and a very fine white head. Sweet candyfloss notes with banana and mango esters. Very tripel-like with lots of fizz, definite alcohol notes and a bit of a metallic tang. Surprisingly smooth mouthfeel, although it does get a bit sticky.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Slaapmutske Bruin ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with ruby hints and a slightly off-white head. Smells of red fruit and roasted malt. Taste is similar with lots of fizz. Generally ok, but a bit too fizzy to be great.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Slaapmutske Tripel ★★
  </span>
  <br />White head and from the aroma it’s definitely alcoholic and sticky. Not actually a huge amount of taste. Lots of carbonation. Taste has some malt and lots of caramel sugar with a bit of yeast. Reminiscent of chewy sweets. Doesn’t do enough to justify the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij St. Bernardus</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  St. Bernardus Abt 12 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy brown with good lacing. Smells of ripe fruit and sweet malt, some spice. Tastes dark and complex, and manages to hide the alcohol. Some brown sugar, spices (clove?) and dried fruit. Very nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  St. Bernardus Christmas Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy and brown. Smells of coriander seeds with some citrus bitterness. Has a fruity, almost gueuze-like taste. Really fizzy in the mouth, yet somehow manages to be creamy at the same time. Long lasting, tingly finish with alcohol notes. Not exciting enough for the alcohol hit.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St. Bernardus Pierre Celis Wit ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy yellow with a small white head around the edge of the glass. Smells wheat with some lemon and orange citrus notes. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Clean tasting with citrus notes, especially in the finish. Quite a rich overall mouthfeel.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St. Bernardus Prior 8 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark, slightly hazy brown with a ruby tinge. Small bubbly head. Well carbonated. A little alcohol in the nose, with some dark fruit. Taste has some dark malt, with breadiness and alcohol. Also a little coffee. Tastes a bit thin and washed out.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St. Bernardus Tripel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy pale amber, not much lacing. Smells slightly of alcohol with some fruit. Slightly creamy mouthfeel with some wheat and hops. Slightly dry finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Straffe Hendrik ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden, slightly hazy with lots of fine carbonation. Good lacing with a thick white head. Smells of citrus with a slight metallic overtone. Smooth, rounded taste with a strong alcohol burn. Some honey/caramel notes. Dry, possibly slightly musty finish. Alcohol is a little too overpowering.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Straffe Hendrik Quadrupel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with tight tan head with good lacing. Smells sweet and spicy. Taste is similar with some liquorice notes. Definitely a sipping beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Keyte Ostendse Dobbel Tripel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark, reddy brown with a slightly off-white head. Smells of dark fruit, red wine/port and roasted malt. Slightly sour with a sweeter finish with further port notes and quite heavy tannins.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Keyte Ostendse Tripel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Lightly hazy golden with very little white head. Smells alcoholic eight a bit of citrus. Quite flat with dryness and warmth. Some citrus and spice in the mouth, but not overly interesting given the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Brouwerij Timmermans</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Timmermans Faro ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a white head. Smells of apples and wood. Quite tart, although there’s also some candy sugar. Not as sour as other beers of the same style, and also lacking in complexity.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Timmermans Lambicus Blanche ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy pale golden with quickly-vanishing bubbles of white head. Smells both sweet and sour, like homemade lemonade. Definite notes of a witbier. Good tingle of carbonation in the mouth. Taste is bright with lemon at the state, leading to light malt and a little spice, and then returning to a nicely tart finish. Very well balanced; this is a seriously good beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Kapittel Blonde ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy, pale golden with white bubbly head. Some hops and candy sugar in the aroma - certainly smells very Belgian. Some wheat banana flavour. Pretty smooth with a little tingle in the mouth. Tastes pretty strong, with a little earthiness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kapittel Dubbel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Ruby red with a large frothy head, which is slightly off-white. Lots of roasted malt aroma, with a little sweetness. Taste is bitter malt with some sweetness. Too sweet.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kapittel Pater ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy brown with a small head which has good retention. Caramel sweetness in the nose, along with some flowery hops. Initial tart taste leads to sweetness and dark malt. Not bad, but not brilliant either.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kapittel Prior ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with good lacing. Smells sweet with definite alcohol notes. Taste is dominated by dark fruit, and the mouthfeel is a bit prickly. Drinkable, but not overly exciting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Poperings Hommel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks Belgian with the distinctive lacing. Golden coloured. Smells slightly sweet with some herbs and spice. Very crisp with plenty of carbonation. Dry malts lead to a hoppy finish. Hoppier than you’d expect from a Belgian beer.</p>

  Kasteel Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very clear amber colour, with a few fine streams of carbonation and a thin slick of head. Smells very clean, faint alcohol notes, along with some sweetness and a little grass. Not as exciting as some other blondes. Clean taste, some sweetness and a little spice with a nicely bitter finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kasteel Brune ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a reddish hue. Large white head. Smells slightly bready. Taste is sweet with some dark fruit. Lingering sweet aftertaste with some alcohol notes. Some carbonation, but a fairly thick mouthfeel. A bit too strong and sweet.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Kasteel Cuvée Du Chateau ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with fine bubbles of off-white head.  Smells strong and sweet. Tastes simiar with too much of both.  Tastes like treacle, with a bit of spice and some more sweetness. Not very nice at all.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kasteel Hoppy ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with very small white head. Smells grassy with some flowery notes. Actually quite hoppy, with flowery and slightly bitter notes. Pretty good.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kasteel Rouge ★★★
  </span>
  <br />To be honest, not what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be a standard Belgian “red”. Actually, it looks like cherry juice with little head. Smells of sweet cherries. Taste is much like a cherry limbic, not too sweet. Some alcohol notes in the finish. Not sure I could drink more than one in a session though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kasteel Tripel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a small white foamy head. Lots of slowly-rising fine carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some sugar, almost cider-like. Alcohol jumps out straight away, and there’s not a huge amount else going on. A little sugary fruit. Lots of carbonation.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  St Louis Kriek Lambic ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark cherry red with white, light head. Smells of morello cherries. Tastes like fake cherry sweets with a little almond. Slightly dry, woody finish. Not too much carbonation. Some tang and aspartame notes. Quite sticky after a while.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  St. Louis Gueuze Lambic ★★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Augustijn Grand Cru ★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Gentse Tripel ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy, pale golden with very little head. Aroma is malts, yeast and some sweet biscuit. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel with an acidic, vinegar sourness. A bit bland other than the sourness, has something of white wine about it.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Gulden Draak ★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish brown. Smells very strong with some dark fruits. Lots of alcohol in the taste, with some fruit and sugar sweetness. Like a Belgian barley wine.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Piraat Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with a large head, reminiscent of Duvel. Not as bitter or hoppy as you’d expect from an IPA. Some hops and some pineapple sweetness. Nice blend of hops and fruity sweetness. Surprisingly drinkable considering the ABV, virtually no alcohol kick, just a warming richness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Piraat Tripel Hop ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy dark golden/light copper with a very sticky white head. Smells Belgian, with definite alcohol notes. Tastes strong and Leffe-like with orange, spices and Christmas aromas. Triple hopped, but not a huge amount of hop flavour, and also quite sweet.</p>

  Buffalo Belgian Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with a very large, frothy white head, Smells of roasted malt with some sweetness. Lots of fizz in the mouth, but other than that it’s quite thin. Not really that stout-like, although there’s a richness and slight bitterness in the finish. Some chocolate as it warms up, but it also becomes quite sticky.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Buffalo Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden with a rocky, white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is light with quite a lot of fizz. Some bitterness, but hard to pin down if it’s from hops or something else. OK, but in no way worth the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lamoral Degmont ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a large, frothy white head. Smells slightly sweet with alcohol notes and some dryness. Tingly mouthfeel with an alcohol hit. Despite that, it’s quite light-tasting for a triple.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Pater Lieven Bruin ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown. Smells of sweets and alcohol. Quite a lot of fizz and not all that much flavour. Partially saved by some dark fruit in the finish, along with some sweetness. Overall too alcoholic and too dull.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pater Lieven Tripel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a small froth of white head. Smells lightly of banana and caramel. Big fizz in the mouth. A bit of spice and alcohol, with a sour bitterness in the finish. Quite sweet, highly carbonated, and strong.</p>

  Westvleteren 12 ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Consistently rated as the best beer in the world, so I was expecting a lot. Dark brown in colour with red tinges. No head, and some sediment from the bottle conditioning. Complex aroma, definite alcohol notes, along with caramel sweetness, carob, and mild dark fruit. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, but very smooth, especially considering the ABV. Malts and some spice, with a twang in the finish, coupled with alcohol dryness. Also some raisin/Christmas pudding flavours and chocolate. Finish is dry and slightly chalky, with warming - but not overpowering - alcohol notes. A very, very good beer. Note: The bottle I had was kept for at least two years.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Westvleteren 8 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with an almost white head. Smells complex with alcohol, spices and malty sweetness. Medium fizz in the mouth. Bittersweet with some malt, leads to a well-rounded aftertaste. Definitely more like an English ale than a traditional take on a dubbel.</p>

  Westmalle Tripel ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy pale orange with a good head. Smells spicy with some pale malt and citrus, and the obligatory alcohol. Quite crisp but a little oily. Fruit followed by spice and some sweetness – very complicated.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Very clear, light copper with a quickly-vanishing just off-white head. Smells of hops, both fruity and bitter, along with an alcohol tang. Tingly mouthfeel, with some bitter and slightly green hops, but not a whole lot else. Smokey notes appear when the fizz calms down.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Vanilla stout. Very dark with a reddish tinge. Quite a lot of fizz, leading to a large, frothy light brown head. Some sweetness in the aroma along with roasted bitterness. Quite fizzy with a definite tingle in the mouth. Subtle and not overpoweringly vanilla though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Phoenix Gold ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours a dark gold with a slightly rocky white head, which has ok retention. Aroma is flowery, with hops and some herb/grass undertone. Crisp tasting with a nicely sharp bitterness and balancing light malt. This is a seriously drinkable light ale. It seems that Byatt’s is going to become an excellent Coventry brewery. Would be excellent with spicy food or just as a summer thirst quencher.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Regal Blond ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Straw coloured with a large, rocky white head. Smells of citrus hops with some green notes. Also some pineapple-like fruit. Crisp and tangy with plenty of hops and a little sweetness. Just as good as the Phoenix Gold.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  XK Strong ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with tan head. Loads of roast malt in the aroma. Rich and full bodied. Very drinkable. Good example of a strong mild.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  XXV ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper, with a froth of white head. Smells slightly fruity. Lots of fizz in the mouth, with fruit, alcohol and bitterness. Tagline is ‘A real ale for real fans - because it’s hard being a sky blue’. I would have gone with ‘Goes down about as well as Coventry City’. Interesting, but a bit too strong.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  XXXmas Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very black with a small tan head. Acetone notes in the aroma, along with bubble liquid. Smokey taste with dark fruit. Quite rich mouthfeel with some bitterness to cut through in the finish. Nasty smell disappears as it warms up, which is nice if unexpected.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cairngorm Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a bubbly white head. Slightly bitter hop aroma, but not a lot going on. Fizzy mouthfeel. Actually tastes quite lagery (more pils than helles) but is nicely drinkable. Perhaps a little smokiness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Nessie’s Monster Mash ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown/red, with a creamy head. Aroma is fruity, perhaps plums, with some bready malt. Tastes quite sweet, with little carbonation. Some toffee and caramel notes, quite warming. Good, but perhaps too sweet to have more than one.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Sheepshaggers Gold ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with little head. Smells of light, sweet malts, but pretty subtle. Body is a bit watery, with vegetable and malt flavours. Underwhelming.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Brown with a reddish hue. Thick white head. Smells Sweet and malty. Taste is more balanced, sweet to start with, backed up by malt and finished with a good hop bitterness. Not too much carbonation.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cunning as a Bag of Weasels ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper with tight white head. Smells sweet and malty. Quite fizzy. Pretty standard with a decent balance of malt and hops.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Deuchers IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Sharp, citrus smell. Quite fizzy, perhaps too much so to be a good session beer. Not a great IPA - missing some hop bitterness, I think, although certainly drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Distant Sun ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper with tight white head. Some orange and malt in the aroma. Orange bitterness. OK.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Flying Scotsman ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a large, tight white head. Smells of roasted, almost burnt malt and caramel, with the associated sweetness. Reminds me of homebrew. Not too fizzy, with a full mouthfeel. Roasted flavour, quite dry, and some spice in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kiss Me Quick ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber, slightly red. Creamy head with good lacing. Smells of toffee with some spiciness. Taste is much the same with a light carbonation. Good session beer, similar to Hobgoblin.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Unmistakably Bill’s ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper, very fizzy pour, with rapidly vanishing sticky head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Malt, some fruit hops and a little bitterness. Nothing really special.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Camden Town</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  India Hells Lager ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale golden with white bubbly head. Lots of resinous US-style hops in the nose. Citrus hops with resinous notes, slightly sticky mouth feel. Bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ink ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with creamy bubbles of tan head. Roasted aroma. Very smooth with only light carbonation. Lots of roasted, bitter flavours. Lingering, bitter finish rounds off a full-bodied, roasted beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Camerons</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Road Crew ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Collaboration with Motorhead. Amber with white head. Light floral and slightly perfumed aroma. Taste is similar but dominated by bitterness and some sweetness in the finish. Meh.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Campbell’s</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Gunner ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with sticky white head. Loads of grain and vegetable in the aroma. Taste is similarly grainy, with a lingering hop bitterness in the finish and some sweet, honey notes. Distinctly OK.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Campervan Brewery</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Spelty Spice ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A saison with a lot going on. You can taste the orange and cardamom. Apparently also has tea in it, and there’s definitely a bit of smokiness. Quite funky and interesting, but perhaps a bit too much going on.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Carbon Smith</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mooze ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with bubbles of off-white head. Loads of malt in the aroma. Very drying with a lot of bitterness in the finish, backed up by a good malt body.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Carlsberg ★★
  </span>
  <br />Straw with a big white head. Smells of stale water with some grain and skunkiness. Taste is similar. Generic, poor lager. Best served very cold.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Schous Pils ★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a pilsner, and, being in Norway, a particularly expensive one. Clear golden, cereal/grass aroma, soft mouthfeel. Slightly sweet finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Tuborg Gold ★★
  </span>
  <br />Sold as Den Gyldne Dame (the golden lady) in Denmark. It’s a clear, golden, somewhat grassy lager. Nice cold sat on a warm night by the harbour in Copenhagen. Probably not recommended otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Carlton &amp; United Breweries</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Victoria Bitter (VB) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Yellow-light-gold in color with a reasonable head. Smells of lager, with a bit more malt than you’d expect. A little grass and grain in the taste. A bit watery but inoffensive and easy to drink.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Cassels</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Alchemist ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with white head. Aroma has lemon and orange. Similar taste with an initial grassiness and a bitter, citrus finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  American Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with patchy white head. Strong aroma of tropical fruit. Similar initial taste, very clean, with a building resin bitterness. Surprisingly short aftertaste. Very nice session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dunkel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Let’s be honest; this isn’t really a dunkel, it’s a fizzy stout. Black with very little head. Slightly sweet with a bitter, dry finish and quite a lot of carbonation.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with no head. Smells like a lager with some grain and a bit of sweetness. Yep, it’s a lager.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  </span>
  <br />Black with off-white head. Smells malty with some chocolate notes. Very full and smooth with an initial sweetness and a slightly burnt, bitter finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a tight, light tan head. Smells surprisingly hoppy (with both citrus and resin notes) with a slight bitterness of roast malt. Tastes a lot lighter than it looks, with some roasted notes but a good hint of hops as well.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Elsie Mo ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale yellow with a large, frothy white head. Hop dryness dominates the aroma. Very clean-tasting with light malt and dry hops which have a nice, lingering bitterness. Also definite alcohol notes. Almost like a good, hoppy Belgian pale ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Castor</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  CC IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden. Lots of grassy and citrus hop aroma. Contains Chelan, Columbus, Chinook and Cascade. Taste backs up the smell, with the addition of a lingering bitter-sweet finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Cathedral</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Red Imp ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured, slightly bitter and fizzy. A bit dull with a tingly mouthfeel.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Celt Experience</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Celt Golden ★★
  </span>
  <br />Organic ale, which was frankly quite disappointing. Bronze in colour, with an aroma dominated by malt, and a little dirtiness. Taste is unexciting and a bit unpleasant at times.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Cervejaria Sul Brasilereira</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Xingu ★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Curious Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with ruby hints. Smells chocolatey. Nicely rounded with roasted malt and a bit of bitterness in a good, lingering finish. Easy to drink, but perhaps a bit thin.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Cheddar Brewery</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Totty Pot ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark in colour, smells quite burnt/bitter in a coffee-like way. Thinish mouthfeel, mostly malt in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">China Resources Breweries</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Snow Beer ★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours a clear, very light yellow. Small amount of carbonation. No real aroma, maybe some yeast. Very light taste, malt with a slight sweetness but a very watery finish. Easy drinking, but genuinely dull.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Church End</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Ales Well That Ends Well ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden bitter with some aroma of hops. A little bland, could do with more hopping, but reasonably drinkable nonetheless.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Arthur’s Wit ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours very light goldens and clear, despite being bottle conditioned. Very fizzy on the pour, with lots of fine carbonation and fizzing head. Medium-fizzy mouthfeel wit plenty of hops (both citrus and bitter) and some light malt. Drinkable, with a long-lasting fry aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fallen Angel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden colour, with a small frothy head. Very bitter, bordering on unbalanced, but nicely refreshing. Lingering bitter aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Gravediggers Mild ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a white head. Some chocolate sweetness mixed with roasted malts. For some reason it just tastes weird.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Hop Gun ★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, no fizz at all and a very small head. Smells a little vegetable. Surprisingly, some fizz in the mouth. Generally ok, but let down by a strange acidic aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Karl’s Berg ★★★
  </span>
  <br />As the name suggests, this is an attempt at brewing a lagery real ale. Pale and lightly hopped, it gets some way of the way there. Unfortunately, it smells a little dirty and is generally uninspiring.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Pooh Beer ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale golden. Made with honey, which is very obvious. Tastes of honey and has a stickiness that builds. If you like honey, try it, otherwise leave it for the bees.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Seahorse ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown colour. Slightly fruity and bitter. Some malt sweetness changes to mostly hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Vicar’s Ruin ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy orange with small bubbly head. Aroma is fruity with some sweetness. Taste is fruit with a mild bitterness and some grassy hops. Simple but drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  What The Foxes Hat ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown with a tight white head. No real aroma but taste is nicely balanced with fruit and hop flavours and a little malt. Drinkable and a good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Church Farm</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Black IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark. Smells quite hoppy and dry. Tastes the same, with a very dry finish. Like a cross between an IPA and a stout. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Ren’s Pride ★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber in colour. Smells of vegetables and fruit with some sourness in the aroma. Not sure this one was quite right. Apparently should be generously hopped. Not awful, but getting there.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Classic Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Straw coloured with small creamy head. Smells of hops. Sweet malts and a dry, bitter finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Cloudwater</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bergamot Sour ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy yellow with no head. Definitely smells of bergamot and maybe some lemon citrus? Definitely a sour! Tart with a lingering finish that I can’t quite place - slightly musty but not unpleasant. Interesting, but doesn’t blow me away.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Cloudwater/Duration</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fool For You ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy dark copper with small white head. Definitely a Saison with the standard funk. Some grapefruit in there, especially in the finish, but more sweet than sour. Interesting, of a little sticky and unexciting.</p>

  Cheshire Gold ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a small white head. Light citrus aroma with slight resinous hops. Taste is resinous lemon, but clean and refreshing. Very drinkable; a good summer session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Flintlock Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with slight vinegar notes in the aroma. Fortunately they don’t come through in the taste, which is very much like that of a helles, with some sweet malt. Pretty well rounded, but the smell is off-putting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Coastal Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hopnotic ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very hazy dark golden/copper with no head. Smells of white spirit and vinegar. Very thin mouthfeel. Some spice and alcohol, with hops in the finish. Pretty average, but tastes a lot better than it smells.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hoptimum ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy dark golden with a very small white head. Smells very sweet and weirdly fruity. Quite thin, mostly just hop dryness and some resin notes. Apparently brewed with six hops.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  West Coast IPA ★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden. Smells weirdly of fake fruit. Very thin in the mouth. Sweet with a bit of caramel taste. Strange medicine notes; reminds me of calpol. Quite strongly flavoured, but not really in a good way. Also tastes overly alcoholic.</p>

  Baltic Night ★★★★

  Isis ★★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Concrete Cow</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Pail Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Light in colour, brewed with lager malts. Doesn’t actually smell or taste of all that much, so probably a good lager replacement.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Coniston Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bluebird Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear and bright, golden in colour. Smells of citrus with a little malt sweetness. Very light, with perhaps not enough biddy. Some malts and a hop bitterness. Nicely carbonated from the bottle conditioning. Dry finish, which becomes more pronounced the more you drink.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Coniston XB ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with no head. Slight citrus fruit aroma. Similar in taste with some lemon. Slightly fizzy but very clean and drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Welsh Pride ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a white, frothy head. Smells slightly hoppy. Some fizz in the mouth. Quite malty with a bit of hop in the finish. A pretty standard bitter.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Coopers</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Extra Strong Vintage Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brown in colour, very hazy with lots of floating yeast sediment (perhaps should have been poured more carefully). Smells perfumey. Lots of fizz in the mouth. Tastes clean with some warming alcohol and sticky sweetness at the end. A bit like cola bottles. Definitely a sipping beer, and a very enjoyable one at that.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Original Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden in colour, with thin white lacing. Smells of citrus hops, with a little yeast. Quite smooth in the mouth, with a nice crispness. Hops give both citrus and bitterness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Original Sparkling Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden in colour, with some floating yeast sediment (which you could easily leave in the bottle). Frothy white head. Some sweetness, maybe honey. Quite yeasty and bready, with a nice touch of hop bitterness, especially in the lingering finish.</p>

  <br />Honey wheat beer. Smells of demerera sugar and honey. Taste is similar, but the sweetness is balanced by the wheat and some crisp hops.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Copper with tight white head. Distinctly average.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Gorse Flower Saison ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Happy Chappy ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with small, lacy white head. Fruity and grassy aroma. Good hop bitterness and less green tasting than it smells. Clean and drinkable with a bit of fizz.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hit The Lip ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with foamy white head. Aroma of fruity hops. Taste is clean and drinkable with a building hop flavour and bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rogue Wave ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orange with a bit of haze. Aroma has quite a lot going on - grapefruit citrus and zest, some hops and resin notes. Taste is similar. It’s good, but not sure it does enough to justify the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  White Out ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a bubbly white head. Aroma of fruit; taste is also fruity (pineapple/orange) with a bittersweet finish. Quite thin.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Top of the Hops ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with 2012 varieties (for some definition of variety) of experimental hops. Copper, with a creamy white head. Unsurprisingly tastes of hops, with bitterness, grass notes and a slight dirtiness. A bit odd.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Crossboarders</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  Porter ★★★
  </span>

  Brewers Gold ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of tropical fruits, coriander and citrus. Very pale, with a surprising amount of bubbles. Light and refreshing, with a bitter, hoppy finish that lingers on the tongue. Very refreshing, but perhaps a little too bland. Very good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  ANZUS IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with one NZ, one Australian and one US hop variety. Golden with lacy white head. Plenty of hop aroma. Good mix of fruity and resinous hops. Very good IPA.</p>

  Stark-porter ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Lives up to its name (strong-porter) by looking and smelling like a stout. Roasted, with coffee undertones. Creamy, light brown head that lasts well. Very well rounded, slightly sweet, with a hoppy bitterness. Slight alcoholic aftertaste, very good mouthfeel, and could be drunk until you were.</p>

  Daas Blonde ★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Worlds End Ale ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Indus Pale Ale ★★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lancaster Bomber ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with a nice head, good lacing. Smells of caramel malt with some grain. Taste is a little thin, some malt with a dry finish. What you’d expect from an English bitter, but a bit unexciting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tavern Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with a tan head. Smells of bitter chocolate. Fizzy mouthfeel with some sweetness and roast malt. OK, but nothing exciting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Thwaites Bitter ★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper bitter with a standard John Smiths / Tetley maleness. Mild aroma, very smooth in the mouth, perhaps too smooth. Reasonably drinkable, but very dull with a slightly strange aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Thwaites Tripel C ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a frothy white head. Smells hoppy. Clean and refreshing with a little tingle in the mouth and a slightly dry and bitter finish. You could drink a lot of this.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Thwaites Wainwright ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very fizzy mouthfeel, which is quite off-putting. Some hops give it a little dryness, but it’s generally very unremarkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Very Nutty Black ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a red glow. Smells of biscuity malt and dark fruit. Tastes similar, with a touch if burnt coffee. Drinkable, but a bit thin.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Dark Star</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Espresso Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Contains freshly ground coffee beans. Jet black, with a small tan head. Unsurprisingly smells almost entirely of coffee; also tastes a lot like coffee, with little else going on. Light carbonation, could possibly do with a little more fizz so you’re sure it’s not just coffee. Quite dry and very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Revelation ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with tight white head. Smells and tastes of bitter hops. Bitterness dominates, but there’s a nice fruitiness in the finish. Surprisingly drinkable, of slightly drying, given the amount of hops in it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Smoked Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with a small white head. Smells of dark malt with a very small amount of smoke. Smooth taste, which is similar to the aroma. Very drinkable, if a little fizzy.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

  Urthel Hop It ★★
  </span>
  <br />Honey-coloured and slightly hazy with little head. Honey and floral aroma. A fizzy mouthfeel with distinct alcohol taste. Some hops and perhaps a little honey in the aftertaste. Also some woody herbs. There are some spices (coriander?) which get stronger as it warms up.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Urthel Saisonnieère ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear lemon yellow with a large white head. Lots of fine carbonation. Aroma has yeast, banana and some candy sugar. Dry pale malts with a crispness and a strong hop finish. Some spice in the finish as well. Very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">De Molen</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Amarillo ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy, dark golden/light copper with a frothy white head. Flowery and slightly bitter hops in the aroma and taste, which also has some fruit notes. A bit astringent in the finish and not as good as some of the other De Molen single hops, although that may be down to hop preference.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Amerikaans ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy golden wit a tight, white head. Smells of American-style hops. Good bitterness in the mouth, along with a nice tingle. Also some tropical fruit notes, perhaps from the hops. Clean and very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Bommen &amp; Granaten ★★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Donder &amp; Bliksem ★★★★
  </span>

  Engels ★★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Hamer &amp; Sikkel ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown rather than black. Creamy, with a slightly off-white head. Smells of bitter, chocolatey malt. Quite clean tasting with roast malt and a bitter tingle in the finish. Quite thin in the mouth, but perhaps that’s to be expected from something that’s supposed to be a porter.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  List &amp; Bedrog ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Aged in bourbon barrels. Dark brown with a tan head. Smells of bitter, roasted malt with a small amount of alcohol. Not really getting any bourbon. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Very rich with coffee and mocha flavours. Lots of roasted malt and certainly tastes stronger than it smells, but not necessarily as strong as you’d think from the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Man &amp; Muis ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy orangey brown with a very small white head round the edges of the glass. Some blackcurrant type fruit, spice and alcohol notes in the aroma. Thin and flat mouthfeel. Some bitterness, but not a lot of aftertaste. The start is definitely better than the end.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Molenbier ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very hazy mid-brown with slightly off-white head. Initial aroma is very sweet with a weird tang, maybe apple. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Initially ok, but very astringent dryness with iron notes that last for ages. Also some vegetable and cranberry notes, and possibly pineapple. Bitter, dry hops dominate after a while.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Single Hop Citra ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a very slight haze and fine, white head. Smells of grapefruit citrus with a slight mustiness. Not too sharp but there’s a good undertone of grapefruit. Subtle and refreshing, a very nice session beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Sladek Hopburst ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy orange-brown with bubbles of slightly off-white head that mostly vanishes quickly. Smells very hoppy - noticeable when you open the bottle. Taste is initially hops, mostly bitter with a small amount of citrus. Alcohol notes come through towards the end. Tingly mouthfeel leads to a lingering hop bitterness which continues to tingle on the tongue.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Vuur &amp; Vlam ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with quite a frothy white head. Smells of American hops and some grapefruit. Tastes similar, with definite grapefruit bitterness and accompanying dryness. It might be a bit of a one-trick pony, but it’s a pretty impressive trick.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Zomer Hop ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy dark copper with a large, white, frothy head. Clean, crisp and slightly resinous hops. Taste is similar; clean and hoppy with floral/resin notes and some dryness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Gageleer ★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy straw-coloured with a white frothy/bubbly head. Smells of fruit and candy sugar, with some spice aromatics. Smells a lot like roast chicken crisps. Some fizz in the mouth. Lots of spice (cloves/lemon/cardamom/coriander), plus some chalkiness. Some medicinal notes.</p>

  <br />Slightly hazy golden with some sediment and a small, tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma, just a little alcohol and yeast. Definitely alcoholic, but not a huge amount of taste other than some sweetness. It’s really all aftertaste and not enough body.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Préaris Blond ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with a very tight white head. Smells of hop fruitiness and some yeast notes. Quite dry and hoppy with bitterness in the finish. Some bready grain in the middle. Nice, clean and quite distinctive. Pretty good.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Reinaert Grand Cru ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brown, with a slightly red hint. Large, frothy white head. Candy sugar, alcohol, and some spice. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Lingering, slightly sweet and tingly aftertaste. Some citrus and dark fruit (sourness) in the main body.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Reinaert Tripel ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very cloudy, orange-amber in colour, with a small white head. Candy sugar and a little fruit in the aroma. Hops, spice (black pepper) and some aspirin/carbonated water in the taste. Very much a triple. Long-lasting alcoholic aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">De Ranke</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Guldenberg ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy yellow-golden, in fact quite cloudy. Smells clean and slightly hoppy, perhaps some tropical fruit. Very, very fizzy, and not a huge amount of taste, especially considering the ABV. Reminiscent of a light Belgian abbey beer with more fizz and not enough flavour.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Saison de Dottinges ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Definitely smells like a Saison - funky and sour. Surprisingly clean with biscuity malt and a slight tang. Pretty good.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">De Struise Brouwers</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  De Struise Wit ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy, slightly golden with a tight white head.  Smells slightly sweet with some soapiness, although there’s not a lot going on.  Very slight fizz on the tongue.  Maybe some honey sweetness and a little grassiness.  Really lacking in flavour, but drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

  <span class="beers_abv">9.0%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">IPA</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />Copper with a small white head. Very, very astringent with not a whole lot else going on. Really awful.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Shark Pants ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Purple/red with a very tight, white head and an awesome bottle label. Not overly hopped in the aroma. Plenty of American-style hops in the mouth, well-mixed with some dry resin notes in the finish. Apparently it’s 300 IBU, which is quite surprising. Doesn’t taste like it’s 9%. Very drinkable, rich and smooth, with plenty going on.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Tsjeeses ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells slightly sour. Very dark copper colour with a small, tannish head. Loads of flavour with smoke and alcohol, giving a whisky-cask flavour. Mouthfeel is thick and malty with some sweetness. A pretty unique beer, which would give even the best Christmas beers a run for their money.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Tsjeeses Reserva ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy dark golden with a white head. Light honey aroma. Taste has lots of spices with pepper, cardomom and ginger. Has a weird, medicinal finish with honey notes, like cheap mead.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Deeside</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  LAF ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light and quite crisp/drying with some herbal notes. To be honest, it’s not all that exciting, but it is drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Macbeth ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with lots of large bubbles on the sides of the glass and a bubbly white head. Some flowery and bitter hops in the aroma. Taste is dominated by bitter hops. Body is a bit thin, but good, lingering aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pacific Kick ★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Golden Fleece ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Emperor’s Whim ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orangey-golden with no head, but large bubbles of carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some hop bitterness. Clean and drinkable; a good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dark Mild ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark, reddish brown with very creamy just off-white head. Roast malt aroma. A hint of bitterness, backed up by dark malt. Solid but uninspiring.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Tommy Legs ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with tight, creamy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Dry and spicy with some malt to back it up. A great example of a standard bitter.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Desnoes and Geddes</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dragon Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Comes in a small (284ml) bottle. Pitch black with some ruby hues and a nice tan head which vanishes almost instantly. Smells of roasted malt with some sweetness. Taste i also malt and sweet, with a creaminess. Finishes with a chocolatey dryness. Could maybe do with a few more hops.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Devils Backbone</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Dogfish Head</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Midas Touch ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with saffron. Cloudy orange with good lacing. Smells very complex with honey and some spices. Also some grape-like fruit. Very different but very drinkable. Tastes spicy with alcohol with a light tartness. Well balanced for the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Donzoko</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Afterglow ★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Bonum Mild ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with no head. Complex, dark and full-flavoured, just as a mild should be. Strong roast malt, full mouthfeel, leading to a very nice finish. [Note: I’ve also had this when it was much less good, a 2 at best.]</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Praetorian Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, small, foamy off-white head. Smells slightly sour with some burnt notes. Taste is very refreshing, surprisingly so for a porter. Very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Ratae’d ★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a small, off-white head. Smells of sweet malts and fruit, plus some grass. Flavour similar.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Summer Light ★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper in colour. Malty aroma. Some bitterness keeps it drinkable, but really only in the same way that water is drinkable. Definite session beer this one.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Downton Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Chimera IPA ★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy bottle conditioned beer. Smells very dodgy, damp carpet/dog with some lemon hints. Taste is better, but isn’t all that hoppy, which is pretty disappointing.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Quadhop ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with tight white head. Grassy aroma, almost like a lager. Clean and lagery with grain and some nice fruity hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Gladeye IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with tight bubbles of white head. Lots of sharp and bitter hops along with quite a lot of fizz. Surprisingly similar to a Helles with a bit more bite. Refreshing and drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Orinoco ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A milk stout. Jet black with a sweet, caramel aroma along with some coffee, roast notes. Medium body with a bit of carbonation. Very well balanced with sweetness, bitterness, roast malt and some alcohol notes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Outaspace Apple Ale ★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  White Stout ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with streams of carbonation and a bubbly, just off-white head. Smells of hops and malt. Quite hoppy and alcoholic. No real resemblance to a stout, much more like a barley wine. Not especially good.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">East London</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Vanilla Orchid Mild ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a tan head. Smells of coffee, spice and maybe some vanilla, but that could be a suggestion from the name. Taste is well-rounded with definite coffee notes and a (in my book pleasant) lack of vanilla.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Ecliptic</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Orbiter IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orangey golden with a slight haze and a small, white head. Not a huge amount of aroma (I have a cold) but a big hit of hops. Well-balanced with some resin and light tropical fruit notes and a little bitterness in the finish. Definitely a US IPA</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Seggie Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with no carbonation or head. Looks like flat coke. Certainly doesn’t smell like it though. Lots of dry, roasted notes along with coffee and cocoa. Some fizz in the mouth. Dominated by dry, roasted malt with a bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Chilli and Ginger Porter ★★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Bunk! #1 ★★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bunk! #2 Smoky Wheat ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with tight, long-lasting white head. Weissbier aroma with spices and a hint of smoke. Smoke in the taste is quite subtle, but definitely there and works well. Taste also has the usual banana and clove spice notes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Paolozzi ★★★
  </span>
  <br />In short, it’s a lager. Clear golden with lots of carbonation and a fluffy white head. Clean and doesn’t really taste of a huge amount. Some malt and sweetness.</p>

  Belfast Blue Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with red hues. Small froth of tan head. Smells slightly skunky with resinous hop notes. Quite thin, with some US-style hops and a little bitter-sweet finish. OK, but wouldn’t be anywhere near a great british bitter.</p>

  Grunge IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper, slightly hazy with an off-white head. Smells of slightly musty, resinous hops. Lots of hop bitterness with some roast and smoke notes in the mouth. A very nice American-style IPA.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bookbinder ★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a malty, standard bitter. Couldn’t really be more average.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">

  <br />It’s essentials Carling…</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Ennerdale Darkest</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Whitehaven ★★★
  </span>
  <br />I’m not sure what `darkestst’ applies to - it’s certainly not the colour. Mid-brown with a small white head. Bitter and hoppy, with a balancing sweetness and a good malt body. Not a bad beer at all, but not really outstanding in any way.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Erdinger Alkoholfrei (blue) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A beer which shows that alcohol free beers aren’t all bad. Hazy golden with large, white head. Smells of malt with much more sweetness than you’d expect from a weissbier. None of the standard banana notes. Taste is also sweet and malty, so it’s not a great weissbier, but not a bad beer in general.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Erdinger Pikantus ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />A book weissbier. Dark hazy copper, with a standard weissbier head. Aroma is banana and spice with some sweetness. Nice big flavour, with caramel malls and some dark fruit. Good mouthfeel, with mild carbonation, manages to disguise the ABV well.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Erdinger Schneeweise ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Erdinger Weissbier ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden coloured with plenty of carbonation. Largish head which dies quite quickly. Smells slightly fruity with some banana and bubblegum. Quite mild taste, mostly wheat and a little tang. Drinkable but not overly exciting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a thick white head. No real lacing once the head vanishes. Smell isn’t ovally exciting, maybe some dark fruits. Some sweetness and roasted malts in the taste, very fizzy. More interesting than the normal weissbier, but still not brilliant.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hefeweis Oktoberfest ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy, mid golden with a smallish white, frothy head. Suspect there would be more head on a full glass. Some flowery hops, and a little banana. Predominantly just very fizzy.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Everard’s Original ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown, bubbles of white head. Very malty, some rich sweetness. Lots of aroma, some nuttiness follows initial burnt notes. Nutty malt in the taste with some fizz on the tongue. Slightly sticky, sweet mouthfeel.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sunchaser ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale gold with a thin white head. Not a huge amount of aroma, some faint bitterness. Tangy hops with some sweetness. Pretty well balanced and would probably appeal to lager drinkers.</p>

  Whakatu ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly cloudy, pale blonde/golden with a creamy white head. Smells somewhat vinegary. Tastes of light malt with citrus (grapefruit) hoppy bitterness. Drinkable, but a bit dull to be anything other than a session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Gurten ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden in colour, with good lacing. Grassy aroma. Tastes very watery, although it could have been a lot worse. OK, I copied the review for Valaisanne, but to be honest I couldn’t tell the difference. Quite why they make so many of the same beers is beyond me.</p>

  Double Dragon ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper, creamy white head. Smells sweet and malty. Very full mouthfeel with malts, a little sweetness and very faint hop bitterness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pizmo ★★★

  <br />Hazy golden with a tight, creamy white head. Some bitterness and fruits in the aroma. Taste is similar, with a bit of a bite and tropical notes in the finish.</p>

  Three Bridges ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with creamy white head. Not a huge amount going on in the aroma or taste. A little bitterness in the finish. Generic but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Day Shift ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with very sticky white head. Some resinous and fruity hops in the aroma. Less hoppy than I was expecting from the description, but still loads going on. Bitterness, resin and fruit notes. Also quite drying in the finish. Easy to drink but with lots of interesting things going on. Perhaps a little muddled, but otherwise hard to criticise.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Moose Mousse ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Chocolate milk stout. Jet black with almost no head - what’s there is definitely on the brown side of tan. Lots of chocolate aroma. Very smooth (almost velvety) with huge amounts of chocolate and a light, lingering bitterness. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Night Shift ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with no head. Light aroma of tropical hops and some roasted notes. Taste has a balance of bitter hops leading though to some tropical fruit notes in the finish. Quite interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tangerine Tart ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with large bubbles on the side of the glass, but no head. Smells of orange/tangerine with some sweetness. Clean taste with some citrus notes and a surprising, sour finish. Pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Ava ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Described as a beautiful hoppy blonde (also gluten free). A very good description. Clean, fresh, interesting balance of hops. Would have no idea it’s GF</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hop ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Grain with some light citrus hops in the aroma. Initially a bit grainy and sweet but then some US-style hops and then a drying finish. Not bad at all.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  SYL ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with red hues and a very lively off-white head. Spicy hop and chocolate, roasted malt aroma. Tingly mouthfeel with slightly astringent bitterness, resin hops, and herbal notes. Very interesting black IPA and certainly not obviously gluten free.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Fischer Brau</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fischer Helles ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with not much carbonation. Smells quite sweet, with a slightly off-putting vegetablyness. Taste is quite sweet and clean, but there’s not a lot going on. Not as good as an Augustiner, for example.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Five Points</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Five Points Pale ★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Flensburger Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />As the name suggests, golden in colour. Has a slightly sweet floral aroma. Tingly, but not too fizzy, mouthfeel. Sweeter than a lot of German lagers, with a little hop bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Flying Dog</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dog Schwarz ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black, opaque with a quickly-vanishing tan head. Smells smokey, with not a lot else going on. Initially fizzy mouthfeel leads to a rich, slightly tingly finish. Taste is all smoke and oak, but not overpoweringly so.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Doggie Style ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured, not a huge amount of head and no carbonation. Smells of floral and citrus hops; I suspect it’s dry hopped. Nice initial taste, with lots of citrus hops but not too much bitterness. A little thin in the mouth, but a nice lingering, dry finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Dogtoberfest ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper, with a small white frothy head. Smells caramel sweet. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel with sweetness followed by a strange bitterness. Really not what I was expecting. Odd.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Doubledog IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper, tight white head. Lots of hops in the aroma, also some dirty vegetable notes. Lots of hops in the mouth as well. Very strong bitterness on the edge of the tongue. Melon/pineapple fruitiness mixes well with the hops.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Gonzo Imperial Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Incredibly fizzy, in fact it explodes out of the glass. Dark brown with a tan head. Smells quite sweet. Fizzy mouthfeel. Tastes slightly burnt and the alcohol notes are too strong.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Horn Dog ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden and hazy. Very small, slick white head. Smells of fruit and caramel, with banana notes. Quite strong, with alcohol burn and dryness. Syrupy mouthfeel. Taste is dark fruit and a lot of alcohol. Some dry hops with a little bitterness in the finish. A bit too sickly.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  International Arms Race ★★★
  </span>
  <br />(Zero IBU IPA.) Hazy golden with very little head. Had at a beer tasting, with two very different results. One smells of smoke and yeast, the other of grapefruit with slight vinegar notes; cloudier ones smell smokier. Cloudy one has yeast and marmite in the taste, whilst the clearer one has grapefruit citrus and bitterness. Oddly, not as good as either when they are mixed. Some sweetness builds throughout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  K9 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden colour with a very thin white head. Smells strong and has a fizzy mouthfeel. There’s a surprising amount of hops with some light malt, giving a nice level of sweetness. Quite clean and refreshing; doesn’t really seem like a Christmas beer at all.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Kujo Imperial Coffee Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours black and oily. Smells of roasted coffee. Serious coffee taste that lingers into a creamy finish. Doesn’t taste anything at all like the ABV. A very nice stout; would be interesting to see how it ages.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old Scratch Amber Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy copper colour with an odd-white head. Some hops, although not a lot of aroma. A little citrus in the taste, with some hop bitterness with a slightly dry finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Pearl Necklace Oyster Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown rather than the black I’d expected. Good tan head. Smells of roasted malts, with a touch of salty brine. Smooth and drinkable. Taste has light roasted malts with a good bitterness and then a minerally finish. Slight oilyness in the mouth.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Raging Bitch ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured, very thin white head. Aroma is all hops. Slightly tingly mouthfeel. Taste is also all hops, with a good mix of floral notes and bitterness. Has a lingering dry finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Snake Dog IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden in colour, with a small, frothy white head. Smells of hops, both bitter and floral, along with a little citrus. Quite highly carbonated. Some grass, bitterness, citrus and a bit of malt. Very dry, lingering finish, One for the bitter-hop lover.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Wild Dog ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Barrel-aged Gonzo Imperial Porter. Pours jet black and oily with a tan head. Smoke and whisky notes in the aroma, along with some sweetness and alcohol. Smooth mouthfeel, very rich with roasted malts and port flavours. Some bitterness and coffee in the finish. Stickiness builds after a while, but it’s not actually very sweet. Very, very tasty.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  WildEman ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Bright golden with marshmallow foam of white head. Some sour noted and hops in the aroma. Clean with some bitterness and alcohol in the taste. Very drinkable; seems like a cross between a saison/weissbier and an IPA.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Woody Creek White ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy light golden with a tight, thick white head. Smells like a wit. Tastes like nice, clean, light one. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Copperhead Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light malty and sweet aroma, reminiscent of an alt. Hazy copper, with a thin, just off-white head. Taste is slightly bitter with some grain notes an a nice hoppy finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tavern Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with a white head. Smells of dirty, resinous hops and malt. Some fizz in the mouth, and the flavour is dominated by resinous hops and a dry finish. Definitely American; don’t expect a British style ale.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Wisteria Wheat ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden. Lots of banana, wheat and clove in the aroma. Very much like a rich, bananary German weissbier. Very nice, but perhaps a little too sweet to have more than one or two.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Forge</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Forge IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with a fake lemon aroma. Mouthfeel is very thin, with more lemon hops and a bit of malt. OK.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Oatmeal Porter ★★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  </span>
  <br />Golden with bubbly white head. Smells of grassy hops with some sweetness. Very clean and drinkable, but nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  2009 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden. Not a huge amount of aroma. Quite fruity. More of a classic IPA than an overly hopped one. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Founders Brewing Company</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  All Day IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a very slightly off-white head. Smells of grapefruit and orange citrus hops, with some hints of mango. Refreshing and clean tasting with a nice tingle in the mouth. A little grapefruit bitterness in the finish. A very nice American IPA, which is remarkably civilised and easy-drinking.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Centenial IPA ★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid golden with a tight white head. Slightly dirty aroma with a bit of malt. Taste is also malty, with a very full mouthfeel. Some sweetness and drying hops in the finish. Gets quite sticky. Boring and somewhat overly alcoholic.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dirty Bastard ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish copper with a very small white head. Dry chocolate malt and cocoa in the aroma. Malty taste, with a bit of dark fruit. Somewhat reminiscent of malt loaf. Some rum notes in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Fourpure</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Juicebox ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pint can. Hazy dark golden with sticky white head. Huge amount of hop aroma, both citrus and resin. Taste is similar - definitely a US style IPA. Nothing subtle, but very flavourful and drinkable. Nice bitterness and tingle in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Session IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />From a can, so no idea of colour or head. Lots of bitter, citrus hops in the aroma. Taste is very clean with some bitter hops. Not a blow your head off American style IPA, but very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Fownes</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  Chocolate Tom ★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddy brown with a chocolate aroma which carries on in the taste. Quite dry with a bitter finish. A bit weird, but I’m not that keen on chocolate.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Ginger Tom ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown, with only a little head at the side of the glass. Smells of ginger nut biscuits with a little lemon. Thin mouthfeel, some tingle. Taste is a little dark fruit, with the ginger being relegated to the aftertaste. It’s a blend of Old Tom and Fentiman’s Ginger Beer, and is as confused as that makes it sound.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old Tom ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Burgundy colour, with little head. Smells of alcohol, with some dark fruit notes. Quite well balanced with some sweetness and a hint of background bitterness. Full in the mouth with medium carbonation. Drinkable, especially for a barley wine.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Freedom</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Freedom Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black, no fizz and a very creamy white head. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, although quite creamy. Heavy malt with some roasted flavours. Very much like Guinness actually.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Bengal Lancer ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear orange with frothy white head. Smells of spicy hops with malt and some caramel sweetness. Also some apple/pear fruit. Initial taste has good spicy hop bitterness and zesty fruit. Quite a sharp mouthfeel, but definitely a quaffable beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Black Cab ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with very little head. Smells of coffee, with well-roasted malt and some sweetness. Nicely full mouthfeel, with plenty of roasted malt and coffee. Not too much carbonation makes this a very drinkable stout. Builds to a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fuller Smith and Turner 1845 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured with a white frothy head. Smells fruity with sweet malt. Taste is full with malt backed up by fruit and just enough bitterness. Well balanced but doesn’t really do anything out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Fuller Smith and Turner Discovery ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden amber with a foamy white head. Aroma is fruity with floral hops. Taste is very watery. Good if you want something with a low ABV, otherwise best avoided.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Fuller Smith and Turner ESB ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear, mahogany colour. Very malty, with a clean hop aroma. Very full, almost chewy mouthfeel with woody notes and some dry hop notes. A little sweetness. Finish is slightly sharp with a hop kick. This is a seriously good strong bitter and could be a dangerously drinkable session ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Fuller Smith and Turner Front Row ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with very little head. Thin and watery. Very boring but nothing really wrong with it. Very slight hoppiness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Fuller Smith and Turner London Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Almost opaque dark brown, almost black. Smells very malty with hints of coffee and chocolate, along with some molasses sweetness. Initial flavour is chocolately, backed up by plenty of roasted malts. Very smooth and well-rounded. Dry finish with a lingering smokey flavour.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Fuller Smith and Turner London Pride ★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells slightly caramelly, with a touch of malt. Also something chemical about it. Almost a smoothflow head. Very uninteresting. I’ve had this in London (this one was in the Midlands) and it was much better.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Golden Pride ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Coppery-gold colour, with a long-lasting, small, tan head. Smells rich and fruity, with a little hoppy bitterness. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, rounded sweetish malts and some lingering hop bitterness. Strong alcoholic notes, as would be expected from the ABV. Definitely not a quaffing beer, perhaps a little too strong.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Seafarers Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber in colour with little head. Smells of bready malt, with some sweetness and nuts. Taste is mostly hops, with spice, citrus and bitterness. Medium bodied and very drinkable. A good beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Spring Sprinter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with bubbly white head. Smells of gooseberry? / tropical fruit with some malt. Quite sweet with malt do dominant and some tropical fruit. Decent, if a little uninspiring.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Edel Export ★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fürstenberg Export ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Oddly, despite this being an export, I’ve only ever seen it in Germany. Although it’s the same ABV as the normal version, it’s significantly more drinkable. Standard golden colour with slightly sweet nose. Taste is lager with pale malt and a slightly citrusy finish. Not bad for a lager, but not great for a German lager.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Fürstenberg Premium Lager ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden, smells like an average lager; tastes like one too. Nothing to see here, certainly nothing premium about it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Highlander ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper colour with a finger of tight white head. Some fruit and hop in the aroma. Quite sweet with malt and some dryness. Quite nice, but perhaps a bit too thin.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sanda Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells surprisingly sweet. Very clean with citrus fruit leading to a lingering bitterness. Very drinkable with plenty going on to keep it interesting. Should come in bigger bottles!</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Vital Spark ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a thin head that vanishes quickly. Smells of dark fruit, roasted malt, and there’s some bitterness. Taste is similar, with nutty overtones and some juicy, berry. Fairly spicy finish.</p>

  Slottskällans Imperial Stout ★★★

  <br />Black with a tan head that fades quickly to a little lacing. Smells of burnt malt with some sweet cocoa and a bit of sourness. Mouthfeel is fizzy; probably too much carbonation. Tastes of roasted coffee and alcohol.</p>

  <br />Deep brown with thin white head. Huge roasted aroma. Flavour is all coffee with some creaminess (from the oats?). Could easily be mistaken for a coffee stout - it’s good to have more brown ales around though.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Glastonbury</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Hedgemonkey ★★
  </span>
  <br />A dark malty bitter with roasted flavour dominating. A bit thin and lacking in a finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Love Monkey ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear copper. Taste and smell are both flowery. A nice summer beer with not too much carbonation.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mystery Tor ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden colour with very little head (although it was poured into a paper cup in a field, so your milage may vary). Aroma is heavy on the floral hops. Taste is excellent with an initial sweetness turning into heavy hop bitterness which lingers. Nice and crisp, a very good summer session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pilton Pop ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brown. Taste is mildly bitter but not really very exciting. Tastes slightly mass produced.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Summer Solstice ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden, with a creamy head. Smells of pale malt. Palate is light, with some sweetness, fruit and flowery hops.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Glebe Farm</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Gladiator Spelt Beer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very grainy smell, slightly hazy amber-orange with no head. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, quite refreshing and interesting with enough hops to balance the grain.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Gloucester Brewing</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Citra ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small white head. Loads of grapefruit hops in the aroma. Clean and slightly bitter with grapefruit notes and a nice, lingering dryness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Goddards</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ale of Wight ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden with large, tight bubbles of white head. Zesty citrus hops in the aroma. Lots of spicy, bitter hops. Clean and drinkable with a lemony finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fuggle-Dee-Dum ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with very tight white head. Smells very rich. Full bodied and slightly sweet with malt and a bit of spice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Scrumdiggity ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with little head. Slightly thin and sweet with definite homebrew notes. However, it’s pretty drinkable despite the vegetably undertones.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Goffs</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Jouster ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear copper with a small white head. Not a lot of aroma, perhaps some malt and a little spicy hop. Taste has some caramel with pale, biscuity malt and some dry hops in the aftertaste. Drinkable but a bit unexciting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  White Knight ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orangey-golden and a little hazy. Smells slightly of fruity hops with some slightly odd burnt notes. Very refreshing with some malt and good hopping. Pretty good.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Golden Eagle</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Original Vienna Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with patchy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Dominated by malt, nuttiness, and a fizzy mouthfeel. Brown ale like.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Golden Valley</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kenyon Oatmeal Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with a slightly oily head. Little aroma. Some roasted malts with a lot of dryness in the aftertaste and some lingering alcohol notes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Good George</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Southfarthing Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Exclusive to the Green Dragon in Hobbiton. Served in beakers so no idea of colour - presume it’s dark. Tan head. Roasted malt and some sweetness in the aroma. Very smooth and drinkable with a good bitterness to keep it interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Good George Brewing</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Girdley Southfarthing Fine Grain ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Served in a beaker at the Green Dragon Inn in Hobbiton so no idea of colour. Large white head. Not too fizzy with a reasonable balance of sweetness and malt.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Goose Island</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Goose Island 312 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale. Smells of yeast, wheat and a little light malt. Little head. Has a fizzy mouthfeel. Quite a light taste, some citrus, a little sweetness and some spice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Goose Island India Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a patchy white head. Smells of flowery hops with a little alcohol. Taste is mostly hops, with a good bitterness followed by sweet malt. Quite an oily finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Honker’s Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />First sight and smell is very reminiscent of an English bitter, so good work on that part. Malty, with a tang of fruit, both of which continue through a long-lasting finish. Also has an almost nutty flavour. Solid and drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Summertime ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with very little head. Smells malty and sweet. Tingly and clean-tasting with a little bitterness. Good summer beer, but not overly exciting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Grain</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  India Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a froth of white head. Smells of American style hops with resinous notes. Smooth, with a bitter finish, which lingers well. A good take on a US-style IPA.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Granite Rock</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bronscombe’s Vision ★★★
  </span>
  <br /> Deep brown colour. Smells malty with dark fruit. Taste is dominated by bitterness with some fruit. Finish is distinctive - almonds or marzipan?</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Great Divide Brewing Company</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hercules Double IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddy brown, with a thin, frothy tan head. Smells of floral hops and liquorice. Very complex, with a nice mix of malt, hops and some spice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Titan IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Bright copper with a foamy white head. Smells of resinous/pine hops with some floweriness and citrus notes. Initial taste is a huge burst of hops, not just bitterness but a whole load going on. Eventually kind-of balanced by the malts, but then moves through to a bitter hop finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Yeti Imperial Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with a tan head. Smells burnt with treacle notes. Viscous with liquorice and lots of roasted malt in the taste. Some alcohol and coffee notes in the finish. Feels very heavy, with a drying powdery finish, reminiscent of cocoa powder.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Great Heck</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Jesus ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with foamy just-off-white head. Spicy hop aroma with hints of dark malt. Definitely a US-style IPA with loads of resinous hops and some bitterness. Not massively well balanced.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Green Flash</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Double Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pitch black, with small bubbles of tan head. Lots of roasted malt and some alcohol in the nose, along with coffee sweetness. Very fizzy. Lots of bitterness and roasted coffee, especially in the finish. Also some alcohol notes. Very strongly flavours, perhaps too bitter. Becomes oddly flowery as it warms up.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  West Coast IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy copper with no real head. Smells like you’d expect from an American IPA, with a big hop hit. Seriously interesting mix of hops in the taste. Well balanced, with a nice, lingering finish that manages to not be overpowering.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Green Jack</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lurcher Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Some fruit aroma. Black with a long lasting, frothy head. Tastes of dark fruits, with some fizz in the mouthfeel. A little hoppy bitterness mixed with coffee. Quite complicated with a dry finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Trawlerboys ★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured with a tight, creamy white head. Good lacing. Smells slightly fruity, has a fizzy mouthfeel with an almost sweet note. Disappointing.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Greene King</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Abbot Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear amber ale with a thick white head. Smells lightly go caramel, with perhaps some fruit. Very smooth, almost like a smoothflow bitter. Hops, caramel and malt, but not overly well balanced.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Greene King IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear amber beer, with an almost smoothflow head. Very mild smell, no sign of the expected IPA hoppiness. Similar in taste, although it does have a slight dryness. Average IPA.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Greene King IPA Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a slightly off-white head. Smells and tastes of clean citrus hopes with a little bitterness in the finish. A good session beer, but nothing overly exciting going on.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hen’s Tooth ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orange with a frothy head. Smells light with grain and a bit of citrus, maybe orange. Smooth mouthfeel, with lightly toasted malt and some spice. Quite buttery. Also some yeast from the bottle conditioning.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hop ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of hops and citrus. Surprising taste, not at all what I was expecting; quite spicy with a dryness and some fruit. OK, but overly complicated.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old Crafty Hen ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells exactly like the Old Speckled Hen (in fact, it’s a blend of that and the 5X), some vegetablyness. Dark copper with very little head. Slightly tingly mouthfeel, some dark roasted malts and a little burnt caramel. A bit too strong for the body.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old Golden Hen ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with a few streams of carbonation and a couple of patches of white head. Smells of clean hops with some tropical fruit notes. Quite fizzy mouthfeel. Taste it malt and fruity hops leading to a sweet, peach-like finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old Speckled Hen ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale copper, with a slight malt and caramel/fruit smell. Tastes rich and somewhat creamy, with a malty and slightly alcoholic aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old Suffolk English ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A blend of a couple of beers. Clear caramel colour with bubbly head. Smells of toffee with some vanilla and dark fruits. Quite smooth with lots of malt. Not very much hops, but does have a herby finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ridley’s Old Bob ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a thick white head. Aroma is dried fruit and malt, with some dark sugar notes. Just what you’d expect from an ESB. Taste is sweet caramel, and there’s quite a lot of fizz.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ruddles Best ★★★
  </span>
  <br />CAmber with a small white head. Smells slightly grassy with light sweetness. Taste is similar with hop and malt quite well balanced. A nice general bitter.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ruddles County ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured bitter, with a quite sweet caramel malt taste. Rounded out with a little hops and some more biscuity malt. Long lasting aftertaste. Drinkable, but seems to be playing it safe.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tolly English Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper, with very little head. Smells sweet and malty. Tastes quite tropical with malt undertones. Good flavour, especially given the ABV. A good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Grey Trees</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Chinookan ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />As the name suggests, a single hop ale. Definite citrus hops in the aroma. Very clean and drinkable. Would make a very good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Grolsch Bierbrouwerij</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Grolsch ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with large white head. Smells a bit skunky/musty with some grain notes. Taste, what there is, is similar. Slightly better than some typical Eurolagers.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Grupo Modelo</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Negra Modelo ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Although it’s Mexican, it was originally brewed by Austrian immigrants, which my explain why it’s actually pretty authentic. Amber in colour with a caramel maltiness and acme light bitterness. Not a great beer, but much better than I expected.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Gueuzerie Tilquin</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Oude Gueuze ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells very much like a gueuze, with sour and musy notes. Clear golden with very fine bubbles of tight, white head. Very tart with sour fruit notes. Quite an extreme gueuze, but very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Guinness</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dublin Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very, very dark brown with small off-white head. Good mix of sweetness and bitterness. Very smooth and drinkable with roast malt and light coffee notes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Guinness Draught ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />As you’d expect from something that’s mass-marketed, it’s very smooth and gentle, and, whilst it’s not a patch on the export bottled versions, it’s an excellent choice that’s widely available. Famous black with white head, has roasted malts and a faint hop tang that is all blended together expertly. Not too heavy to drink a `few’ pints in an evening.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Guinness Extra Cold ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Guinness Draught, but colder. All this achieves is damping down the taste. I don’t see the point, even in summer, but there’s really nothing different to the draught version, especially if you put it in the sun in a sunny beer garden for a bit.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Guinness Foreign Extra ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours like oil, with a head that leaves lots of lacing as it quickly disappears. Smells sweeter than the Irish versions. Warming, dark roasted, alcoholic taste - almost like an Imperial stout. Sourer than the other Guinnesses.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Guinness Foreign Extra ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very different to the Nigerian brew of the same name. Much less of an aroma, but has the same roasted malt taste. Despite the percentage, tastes somewhere between the Special Export and Original, being somewhat fizzy and more mild in taste than the Special Export.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Guinness Milk Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with tan head that disappears almost instantly. Aroma has mineral notes and sweetness. Quite fizzy. Taste is quite sweet with a lingering bitterness and an almost acidic finish. A pretty good milk stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Guinness Original ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks great, thick, with an off-white head. Malty aroma, and somewhat fizzy on the tongue. Very drinkable, but missing the warmth and kick of the stronger export versions.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Guinness Red ★★
  </span>
  <br />Essentially Guinness-light; lighter malt, lighter taste. I’m not really sure why you’d drink it. If you want a stout, drink Guinness, if you want a smoothflow bitter, pick another one.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Guinness Special Export ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, with an off-white head. Smells of dark, roast malts. Very smooth and incredibly drinkable. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, all the things you want from a stout. Surprisingly bitter hoppiness for such a dark beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rye Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orangey-golden with just off-white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Initially clean with some spice and bitterness. Finish is a bit muddled and lingers. OK but nothing special. Not sure that the rye is a good thing.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  West Indies Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with small tan head. Roast malt with alcohol and hops. Good mix of sweetness, bitterness, malt and a slight tingle. Quite a lot like the special export with roast coffee finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Gulpner</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Chateau Neubourg Pilsner ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with small white head. Smells like a pils - some grass and malty. Clean and slightly bitter, with a little bit of grain/grass.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">HaandVryggeriet</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fyr and Flamme ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish with small bubbles of white head. Some fruit and hops in the nose. Slight citrus (orange?) taste, leading to a bittersweet finish with a hop dryness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hacker-Pschorr Brau</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Animator ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a rapidly-vanishing head. Smells sweet and strong. Taste is surprisingly light on alcohol, with some caramel and malt. Also some warming, spice notes, along with a touch of marzipan? Worryingly drinkable!</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hacker-Pschorr Kellerbier ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden with a large, frothy white head. Slightly sweet and malty. Finish is clean with some spice and bitterness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hacker-Pschorr Müncher Helles ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a small white head. Smells grassy with bready malt and some sweetness. Taste is clean and grainy with some hop. Clean and crisp and very drinkable. An excellent summer beer, but doesn’t try to do too much.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Oktoberfest ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a small white head which froths well. Really not a lot of aroma, some sweetness and grain. A little fizz in the mouth. Taste again has a bit of grain and sweetness, but there’s not a huge amount of taste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hadrian Border</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Farne Island ★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber coloured. Smell has a greenness to it, which is somewhat off-putting. A reasonable blend of malt and hops, but the smell isn’t great at all and mars the taste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Secret Kingdom ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark and rich. Smells jammy, with sweetness and blackcurrant notes. Roasted malts dominate and are followed by some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hambleton</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mindful IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a white head. Aroma of light malt and citrus hops. Taste is similar, with a bit of sweetness. It’s a very decent light beer and hard to tell that is low alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hanlons</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Copper Glow ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep copper colour. Quite a lot going on, but dominated by being sweet and sticky. Still a good pint though.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hanssens Artisanaal</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Oude Gueuze ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pop cork bottle. Orangey-yellow with large bubbles of head. Lots of large carbonation, especially on the sides of the glass. Smells sour, with champagne and cider notes. Fizzy and crisp mouthfeel. Very dry and tart, this definitely isn’t a quaffing beer. Makes you salivate. Apple sourness continues into a dry finish. Would be good with food, it does get a bit sour otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Harbour</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  India Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with lots of fine streams of carbonation and a large, thought white head. Aroma has hops, mostly flowery. Clean and light with some hop bitterness and fruit, but could do with more. Lightly dry finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hardknott</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Cool Fusion ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with white head. Smells and tastes of spices. A bit weird but drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dark Energy ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, with a massive, frothy tan head. Smells rich, dark and fruity with spice notes. Very fizzy. Some bitter-sweet notes and a bit of spice. Very complex, but the fizz is too dominant.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  English Experiment ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with a large white head. Lots of hops in the aroma. Quite a lot of fizz in the mouth. Flavour is a well-rounded mix of hops. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hardy and Hansons</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rocking Rudolph ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark ruby with a small head. Some hops and spiciness. Some fruit and caramel, although a bit thin. Distinctly average.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Harvey’s</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Armada Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with very little head. Very average bitter, but that’s not always a bad thing; perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />A recreation of a 19th Century beer, complete with a cork. Smells of dates/raisins, with the addition of some malt. Very dark, with a warming alcoholic hit. Complex, with dark fruits and a smokey, almost burnt note. Long finish, with more of the same tastes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Harvistoun Brewing Company</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Bitter and Twisted ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very clear and bright with a small white head. Smells quite soapy, with some chemical undertones. Light and crisp, but the soapy smell is somewhat overpowering. A few hops in the finish, but a bit disappointing.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Grizzly ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Darkish brown with creamy white head. Resinous hops in the nose. Loads of hops, bitter and slightly spicy in the mouth. Very reminiscent of a dark American IPA. Interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Natural Blonde ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with white head. Some light hopping in the aroma. Plenty of hops in the taste with a lovely lingering bitterness. Clean and easy drinking.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Ola Dubh 12 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with small tan head. Smells dark and sweet with hints of treacle and alcohol. Very rich and full bodied with liquorice, bitterness, roasted malt and light alcohol notes. Very complex and rich. Definitely a sipping beer!</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Ola Dubh 18 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />With the name meaning black oil, it’s unsurprising that this pours a very viscous black. Aroma and taste are both peaty whisky, with an accompanying thick mouthfeel. Tastes very strong (perhaps even stronger than the ABV), but this provides a nice warming accompaniment to the smokey aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Old Engine Oil ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, essentially black. No head, but some fizz and tan lacing. Smells of chocolate and nuts (nutella?), with some coffee notes. Very chocolatey with a little dark fruit. Lots of dry roasted malt in the finish. Not too heavy. Very full finish to a very nice beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Schiehallion ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden colour with a small white head. Not a huge amount of carbonation. Smells hoppy and slightly florally. Surprisingly full mouthfeel, hops and bitterness. Like a good German lager.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Shenanigans Black Lager ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed as Schiehallion, but with the addition of roasted malt and barley. Very dark brown with little head. Smells of roasted malt. Not a huge amount of taste, may benefit from being served a little colder.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sorachi Pils ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, with tight white head. Quite an astringent bitterness in both the aroma and taste. Perfectly drinkable but nothing exciting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  The Ridge ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with a hoppy aroma. Surprisingly malty at first, leading to bitter and slightly resinous hops. a bit jarring.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Wild Hop IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with patchy, bubbly white head. Clean, bitter, hoppy aroma. Taste is similar, definitely dominated by bitter, drying hops, but very clean with a good, lingering finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hastings</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Handmade 18:Rye ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />A RyePA. Very dark, although that belies the amount of hops in both the aroma and taste. Mostly fruity, with a bitter finish. Very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hatherwood</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Plunged Orange ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a white head. Smell is definitely orange, almost soft-drink-like. Flavour is much better balanced with light orange notes, some bitterness from hops and sweetness. Quite fizzy.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  The Green Gecko ★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a new world IPA. Tropical fruits and zesty hops in the aroma and taste. Spicy, peppery finish. Very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Hausbraurei Zum Schlussel</span></p>

  </span>
  <br />Rhubarb saison. Hazy golden. Smells a bit odd - I get some sweet, BBQ sauce-like notes. Pretty drinkable, some sharpness (from the rhubarb?), spice and vanilla creaminess. Bittersweet finish. OK, but I don’t really get the rhubarb.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  <br />Dark copper with a washing-up liquid head. Smells of grain and herby/spicy notes. Quite fizzy. Spicy bitterness with light smokey notes and a slightly bitter finish. Quite interesting, but also a bit odd.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Cuillin ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with bubbly off-white head. Smells of roasted malt with some honey sweetness. Full and rich mouthfeel, almost like a creamy stout. Nice dryness in the finish with warming spices.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Blaven ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep golden. Smells malty with light hops. Taste is similar. Surprisingly malty with some hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Cuillin Beast ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a patchy white head. Smells burnt and jammy. Taste is a bit weird with some caramel and fruit. Not well balanced at all. Definite homebrew notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  </span>
  <br />Made with porridge oats. Dark golden. Light bitterness in the aroma as well as some sweet fruit notes. Clean, creamy with a little bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hebridean Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Gold with a small head. Smells slightly sweet. Tingle in the mouth. Very clean and drinkable, with a slightly bitter finish. Nothing special, but a good sessio beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Skye Red ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Quite deep golden. Smells bitter, sweet and nutty. Taste is similar. OK.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Tarasgeir ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a patchy white head and no carbonation. Smells peaty. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy. Tastes like an islay malt with ice and water. Some sour gueuze-like notes in the finish, and perhaps a touch of ginger. The smokiness comes to dominate as it warms up. Weird, but not in a bad way, although I suspect this is a love-it-or-hate-it beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Itchen Valley</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Calypso ★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Brewer’s Dark ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks like coke, with no head and large bubbles of carbonation. Smells slightly sweet with roasted malt. Quite thin in the mouth (which is probably to be expected from the ABV) but some sweet and coffee notes. Has a fizzy, tingly finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Harvest Ale 10 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with fine streams of carbonation. No real head, but a small amount of bubbly lacing. Smells very well-rounded with lots of sweet malt. Oddly for the ABV, there’s no real alcohol notes. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is very complex with some sweet molasses malts and a lingering finish of spice and dark sugar. Also some smokey notes. No alcohol burn. Very nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Manchester Star Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells dark and alcoholic with roasted malt and sweetness. Rich and smooth with roasted flavours and since sweetness. Definite sipping beer.</p>

  7 Bells ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with creamy head. Alcohol and roasted notes, but pretty well balanced aroma. There’s definitely alcohol notes, but also some creaminess and roasted malts, with a bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Drop ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Gold with a tight head. Floral and citrus aroma. Described as a session IPA and rather lacking in punch, but definitely drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Reef ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Zesty hop aroma with light malt. Clean and crisp with a little bitterness in the finish. Nothing particularly special but nothing wrong with it either.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Surf ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with very tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. However, loads of exotic fruity hops in the taste. This could easily be a very fancy Belgian beer. This is a seriously good beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Wave ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy dark golden with tight white head. Smells slightly spicy with a bit of banana. Typical weissbier flavours. Probably shouldn’t be served at real ale temperature.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Snecklifter ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark burgundy colour, with a creamy head. Smells of dark fruit, with perhaps some coffee. Incredibly drinkable, although very complex, with bitter hops, malts and fruit. Lovely smooth mouthfeel, like a good stout. Long, pleasant aftertaste, far too drinkable for its strength.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Westmorland Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with a tight white head. Smells of light malt with a bit of hopping. Very clean in the mouth with a light hop taste. Nice session beer, but a bit unexciting.</p>

  Sour Mash Brew ★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with bourbon and fruit alcohol, whatever that is. Initial aroma is very odd, somewhat like a shandy, although the taste isn’t so bad. Quite sweet and sticky with cola notes. Too sweet.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Jever</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Jever Pils ★★
  </span>
  <br />Disappointing, very bitter, but not in a good way. Smells grassy, tastes slightly sweet, almost like it’s not fully matured, but then has a shockingly bitter aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  John Martin’s IPA ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with frothy white head. Smells a bit lagery with floral hops. A bit metallic with some herbiness and a little sweetness, with a dry finish. Quite a lot of tingle in the mouth. Some hints of a generic lager.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  John Martin’s Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with small white, bubbly head. Large bubbles of carbonation but not that fizzy in the mouth. Smells of malt with caramel. Taste is biscuity with caramel and a little hop in the aftertaste. Bitter and sweet but a bit confused and not very crisp or clean; a bit unbalanced.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Jopen Hoppenbier ★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly cloudy golden, with white head. Smells like a Belgian pale ale with a bit of candy sugar and some dry hops, No obvious fizz, however, very fizzy on the tongue. Plenty of dryness in the aftertaste, but the fizz masks any actual taste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Tempelbier ★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, white lacy head. Smells quite sweet. Doesn’t taste of a lot. Distinctly average but drinkable. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dark Moor ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark mahogany with an off-white head. Smells slightly of caramel. Complex balance of dark fruits and hops. Interesting but for some reason I wasn’t excited by it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Jaguar ★★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Misty Law ★★
  </span>
  <br />Blonde-golden in colour, with a frothy white head. Somewhat bland, although it does have some hoppy bitterness. It could do with a bit more then it would probably be a nice session beer.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with a small, patchy white head. Slightly grainy taste with a little sweetness. Pretty well-rounded, but perhaps a little too sweet. However, there’s a bit of dryness in the finish. Obviously quite strong and not a quaffing beer.</p>

  Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Rich brownish red colour with a small off-white head. Smells sweet, with caramel malt and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the smell, with some alcohol notes and good body from the malt. Very good example of what a Bock can be, tasty and not overpowered by the alcohol.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Grouse Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark and very frothy, presumably due to it being bottled conditioned. Smells slightly sour/burnt with some malty biscuitness. Surprisingly little taste, but does have a dry aftertaste with some hop bitterness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Double Sunset ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden ale, very small head and not overly fizzy. Smells of fruit and hops. Quite sweet tasting with some hint of peaches.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rudyard Ruby ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark ruby, with a small tan head. Some malts and a little sweetness in the aroma. Some hops but a strange sourness, although still drinkable. A bit thin.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Staffordshire Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very fizzy, clearly bottle conditioned. Bright golden yellow with a frothy head. Floral aroma, some citrus. A nice initial sourness which lasts through to the aftertaste. Very hoppy and dry.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Lees</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Moonraker ★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish-brown with strong malt aroma. Taste is sweet. Definitely too sweet and too alcoholic.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  400 Pound Monkey ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light amber, with a thin white head. Aroma is dry hops, some alcohol and citrus, so what you’d expect from an IPA. Quite a floral taste with some dryness and a contrasting, rounded malt. Some alcohol dryness in the finish, along with some tea-like notes. A little astringent in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Black Jack Porter ★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours black with no head. Strong alcohol notes in the aroma and lots of dark fruit in the taste. Other than that it’s very flat and dull.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Milk Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />No actual milk in this - it contains lactose. Very dark brown with a finger of tan head, which doesn’t last all that long. Smells like you’d expect from a stout with, with roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Initial taste is sweet roasted malts and some slight coffee bitterness coming through. Mouthfeel is very creamy, but there’s enough carbonation to stop it being cloying.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Lervig/Hoppin’ Frog</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Sippin’ Into Darkness ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Ok, let’s get this in early, it’s amazing. Described as chocolate Martini Imperial stout, and that’s pretty accurate. Loads of chocolate and some alcohol in the aroma. Clearly high ABV, but it’s worth it. So much going on and a lingering dry and chocolaty finish with some bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Lerwick</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Azure ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Described as a light, hoppy ale. It’s exactly that with quite a lot of fizz.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Blindside ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Yep, it’s black with a foamy white head. Interesting aroma (I have a cold) - pretty complex mix of hops. Plenty of bitterness, with lots of different hop notes. Lingering dry bitterness in the finish. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Liberation</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Liberation IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden copper with a white, creamy head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Slightly weird mix of bitterness and dry hops, but finishes quite clean. Lingering, interesting but not quite placable aftertaste.</p>

  Little Creatures Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly cloudy amber (unfiltered, which is nice), with a white head that leaves sticky lacing. Smells slightly appley with some malt and almost metallic notes. Crisp taste with some sweetness and citrus hops contrasting nicely with the light malt. Refreshing and very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Little Earth Project</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

  South Island Sour ★★★★

  <br />Hazy golden. Definite sour and funky yeast notes in the nose. Actually pretty well balanced. Some sour notes (obviously) but also some dry hops and nothing too harsh. Interesting and very drinkable for the style.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Little Valley</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  Fiesta Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden/blonde colour. Smells of tropical fruit. Light taste with some more tropical fruit in the finish. Apparently hopped four times with American hops. Very drinkable, but maybe it should do a bit more with the hops.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Longden</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Sawn Off ★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured. Smells and tastes generic and under done. Possibly at its best at the beer festival.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Longman</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Long Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with a very hoppy aroma. Taste has some hop bitterness but it strays into vinegar sourness, which isn’t great. However, it’s still very drinkable, with a slight gueuze edge, which is fine by me. Not sure it’s deliberate though.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Smoke House ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish amber with small white head. Wood fire smoke in the aroma. Taste is similar, with quite a biting smokiness. Interesting, but definitely not for everyone.</p>

  <br />Very clear golden with a very fine, white head and streams of carbonation. Smells very malty with toffee overtones, pineapple and popcorn notes. Tastes like it should be in one of those fancy green squash bottles. Definite lack of beeriness.</p>

  Common Grounds ★★★

  <br />Triple coffee porter. No real surprises. It’s very dark with a brown head. Smell and taste both dominated by coffee. Not too much fizz. Pretty smooth. Does exactly what it says on the can.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dairyfreak ★★★

  <br />Very black. No head. Lots of dark and roasted aromas. Quite fizzy and sweet. Some bitterness keeps it relatively rounded. Okay.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fantasma ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orange golden with bubbly white head. Large fruity and resinous aroma. Bittersweet taste doesn’t quite deliver the hops suggested by the aroma. Dry finish. Would definitely not know it’s gluten free!</p>

  Un-human Cannonball ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden orange with a rapildy-diminishing white head. Skunky nose with some burnt orange. Plenty of hops in the mouth with fruit first, leading to a very bitter, drying finish. Doesn’t taste anything like the ABV. Very drinkable and dangerous. Also suitably complex - you get something different with every sip.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Mallinsons Alias ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />(With Stella/Ella hops.) Slightly hazy golden (b/c) with creamy, tight white head that reduces quickly. Loads of floral/fruit (passionfruit/grapefruit?) in the nose, perhaps a touch of spice as well. Crisp taste with more spice in the mouth leading to a drying bitterness that lingers. Quite and unusual and powerful hop but nice and also something a bit different.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Lost Your Marbles ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with no head. Smells slightly sour with some sweetness. It’s supposed to taste like black forest gateaux. I sort of see where they’re coming from, but it’s just not very nice. Maybe if you’re really keen on sour cherry and chocolate.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Marble Dunkel ★★★
  </span>

  </span>
  <br />Hazy orange-golden with a tight white head. Smells quite sweet, with mango and a litle hops. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is slightly soapy with a little fruit, but not a huge amount else going on. Good hop bitterness in the finish saves it somewhat.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Oyster Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Almost completely black with faint red tinges. Off-white head. Smells woody with some subtle smokey notes and some dark soft fruit. Taste is very complex with some dark sugar sweetness, dark chocolate and a developing bitterness. Some carbonation, but very quaffable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pedigree ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a white head. Smells light with some sweetness. A bit of roasted malt and hops at the star. Finishes quite dry. Medium carbonation. Gets a bit dull.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Simply Dark Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with very small bubbles of tan head. Roasted, slightly dark fruit aromas. Tingly in the mouth. Roast malt, slightly sour and dry. OK.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Simply Golden Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden. Not a huge amount of aroma or taste, but would be a decent session beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Simply IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Quite dark golden with frothy bubbles of white head. Smells malty with some light hopping. Crisp and malty with some biscuit and creamy notes. Essentially a bitter rather than anything approaching an IPA. Perfectly drinkable though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Strong Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear orange with a frothy white head and good lacing. Smells of fruit with flowery notes and caramel sweetness. Taste is similar, with some maltiness. The sweetness fades out to leave a bitter finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Mashonistas</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Atacama ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brut IPA. Golden yellow with small white head. Lots of tropical fruit aromas. Dry and resinous with some fruit notes in the finish. Pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Darc Almond ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Not milk stout (almond milk). Very dark. Smells and tastes quite sweet with some bitter notes. Thinner than I would have expected from the look.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Madame Geneva ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Yellow with bubbly white head. Smells sour with lemon notes. Clean and drinkable. Not as sour as some, which is a good thing. Gentle and a good intro to the style.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Reeses 2B Cheerful ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Imperial porter. Definite aroma of peanut butter. Also some coffee notes. Ferrero Roche? Pretty dry with those notes in the taste, too. Smooth and very drinkable. Definitely doesn’t taste like the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Slurple Haze ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very hazy yellow, almost looks thick. Some dry hop aroma. Taste is pretty complex with bitterness and drying resin hops in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Maxim</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Double Maxim ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a slightly off-white head. Smells light, perhaps some malt and hops. Quite dry, but not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">May Hill</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Legend ★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Ducking Stool ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden colour with a small head. Strangely sour, seemingly not in a deliberate way. Some malt and then a hoppy dryness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">McColl’s</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Suma ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber/golden with a white head. Aroma has lots of citrus, with resinous hops. Taste is very similar, with light carbonation and a dry, bitter finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">McEwan’s</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  McEwan’s 70 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured with tight white head. Sweet malt and a little fruitiness. Decidedly average but drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Meantime</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Boadicea ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Single variety hopped golden ale. Pale golden. Light, fruity aroma.  Good hit of bitter hops with almost a gueuze sourness in the finish.  Really interesting and would be a great summer garden beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Coffee Porter ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very fizzy when poured, looks like coke. Very dark, with a slight red tinge. Smells somewhat of roasted coffee, although there’s also some dark, bitter chocolate in there. Lighter body than I was expecting, perhaps a little too watery. Little fizz in the mouth either. Tastes of coffee, with as minerally/metallic tang, and a bit of malt sweetness. Long, slightly chalky finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kikku ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Flavoured with shichimi. Golden with no head and little visible carbonation. Has a distinctive aroma, but hard to pin down. Clean with some aromatic hops and an interesting spiciness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Meantime Chocolate ★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks like slightly fizzy black coffee. Smells of chocolate biscuits and some burnt malt. Fizzy mouthfeel, but thin and bland. Some (fake) chocolate taste, plus a it of coffee.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Meantime IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Surprisingly tame smell, lacking in the expected hoppy fruitiness. Definitely has the strength of an IPA, but without the bitter hops it tastes too strong. Quite drinkable, but not really an IPA.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Meantime Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with no bubbles of carbonation or head. Doesn’t smell of a whole lot. Taste is clean and crisp with a little hop in the finish. Could do with coming in a bigger bottle.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Meantime Pilsner ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden, with a few small bubbles and a white frothy head. Smells of light (crystal?) malt. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, with a little citrus. Aftertaste is all pils - clean lager with a little hops. Pretty good.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Salted Caramel Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Medium brown. Loads of roast malts and some sweetness in the aroma. Taste is similar with hop bitterness and a reasonable amount of carbonation. Rich and quite sticky - a sipping, rather than quaffing beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Merry Miner</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Methane ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a very weird taste, almost an almond nuttiness. Distinct alcohol notes as well.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Mild ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark. Tastes and smells of a whole lot of not a lot. Some slight roast in the finish. Disappointingly bland.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Warwickshire’s Finest ★★
  </span>
  <br />No, it’s really not. Light amber, pretty bland session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Mighty Hop</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Wot Ho Ginger Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed using fresh ginger, so perhaps unsurprisingly smells and tastes of ginger. Nothing wrong with it, just not my kind of beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Mikkeller</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Amarillo Single Hop IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy, dark copper with a rocky white head. Smells very hoppy with some resin notes. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel but not as much hop in the taste as you’d expect from the aroma or the other Mikkeller single hop varieties. Almost buttery in flavour with a little bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Beer Geek Breakfast ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with a few foamy bubbles of brown head. Quite oily. Smells of roasted malt, coffee and alcohol notes. Initially quite a creamy mouthfeel. Rich coffee and dark chocolate in the mouth, along with lots of bitterness in the finish. Complex and well-balanced, but perhaps the finish is too harsh.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Beer Geek Brunch (Weasel) ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours black and oily with milk-chocolate coloured head, which vanishes pretty quickly. Smells of coffee, with some additional dryness. Smooth, full mouthfeel with definite coffee taste leading to a very nice bitterness in the finish. Very well-balanced and drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black (Chinese character) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very black, as the name suggests, with a dark, tan head. Lots of dry, sweet, roasted malt. Very full mouthfeel, with an obviously very high ABV. Quite a sweet, sipping beer. One to share and to spend an evening with.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Black Hole (Cognac) ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Completely black with a large finger of bubbly, brown head. Smells slightly burnt with dark chocolate and cognac. Sweet honey with alcohol that goes into coffee noted and roasted malt. A log going on, but is well-balanced. An incredibly interesting and drinkable stout. Doesn’t taste anywhere near as strong as the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Centennial Single Hop IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a patchy white head. Smells of resinous hops. Tastes similar, and indeed similar to the other Mikkeller single hops. On a par with the citra, but with a very different hop profile.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Citra Single Hop IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy, dark bronze with a large, foamy white head. Lots of hops in the aroma, with lemon curd notes. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, with lots of bitterness and a light grapefruit tartness in the finish. Also some tropical fruit in there.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Drinkin’ in the Sun ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden yellow with tight white head. Smells and tastes of citra style hops with plenty of grapefruit, especially in the finish. Also some sweetness. I really wouldn’t guess this was low alcohol.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Green Gold ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper. Nose is all hops with a good mix of resin and elderflower aromas. Nicely balanced, and definitely very hoppy, IPA. Another very good Mikkeller beer that just works.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mikkeller Weizenbock ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with a white head that leaves good lacing. Smells of wheat, yeast and alcohol. Very full mouthfeel with definite alcohol notes. Definitely a bock. Some hops in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Nelson Sauvin Single Hop IPA ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed at De Proef, Belgium. Dark amber with a small, fluffy white head. Smells of grapefruit and a little light malt. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Plenty of grapefruit, with the associated dry, tingly bitterness in the mouth. Some spice notes as well. An excellent IPA, more American in style than you’d predict from two European breweries.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  The American Dream ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with frothy white head. Nose and taste both have lots of citrus, bitter hops. A bit one dimensional, but very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Milestone</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  American IPA ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden, with very fine streams of carbonation but very little head. Tastes quite flat and thin with some resinous hops in the finish. Also some off-putting hints of metal.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Black Pearl ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a frothy head. Smells of roasted malts and has a similar flavour, with the addition of some coffee notes. Some dry bitterness which contrasts nicely. Very smooth mouthfeel, which turns a bit dry towards the end. Quaffable!</p>

<p>bottle</p>

  <span class="beers_abv">3.8%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">Bitter</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />Hazy golden with no bubbles and very little head. Smells salty and sour like a jar of capers. Some fruit in the background and lambic-like notes with vinegar and bitterness. Not disgusting nor offensive, but I really have no desire to drink it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Somer Wheat Beer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden in colour. A continental-style wheat beer with a good, zingy finish.</p>

  Vanilla Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a creamy white head. Smells of chocolately roasted malt. VEry creamy with lots of roast malt and a hint of vanilla, but it’s not overpowering. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Moa Brewing Company</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Festive Red IPA ★★★

  <br />Reddish copper with white head. Smells of bitter hops. Very clean tasting with some resin in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Moa Methode ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a tight white head that lasts well. Grainy notes in the aroma. Lots of flavour, but it’s a bit dirty with a weird chemically finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Original Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark for a lager - copper coloured. Very little aroma. Clean and slightly spicy taste. Very drinkable. Some grainy malt in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pinche Guey ★★★

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Mongozo</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mongozo (Coconut) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />I generally don’t do fruit beers, but this was weird enough to warrant trying. Cloudy yellow with a little head. Unsurprisingly smells of coconut, with some sweet creamy notes. Tates a lot like I’d expect fermented coconut milk to. Quite refreshing and clean. I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">

  <span class="beers_abv">3.6%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">Fruit Beer</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />Light, slightly hazy golden with no fizz and a rapidly-vanishing head. Apricot aroma. Very sweet, and tastes more like peach/apricot than mango. Very sticky, and too sweet. Really not very good.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mongozo (Palmnut) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper, slightly cloudy with a tan head. Smells like orange jelly. Sweet and fruity with alcohol notes. Complex with some spicing, but surprisingly little aftertaste. Does a lot, but is a bit weird. Apparently based on an Angolan beer.</p>

  </span>
  <br />A dark ruby beer, smells slightly sour and of hops. Taste is a little sour, very reminiscent of an oud brune. Sourness isn’t overpowering, well balanced by the malts. Very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Oasis ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly cloudy, witbier-like in appearance. Frothy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Nice, clean taste with a slightly tingly mouthfeel and a little bitter hop. Very nice session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hung Drawn ‘n’ Portered ★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Winter Solstice ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a tan head. Smells of roasted malts, but has a much milder taste than you’d expect from the appearance. Small amount of roast malts with some bitterness. Very drinkable, but less exciting than I was hoping.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Even More Death ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very, very dark with tan head. Sweet aroma with dark chocolate, roasted malt and obvious alcohol notes (unsurprisingly). Mouthfeel is oily. Taste is sweet with more chocolate and possibly coconut. Definitely a sipping beer, but very indulgent.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

  Nøgne Ø #100 ★★★★

  </span>
  <br />Very black with a creamy tan head. Smells of roasted malt with dark fruit, a little smoke and alcohol notes.

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Nøgne Ø Wit ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with a finger of tight, yet frothy white head. Smells like a Belgian wit, with lemony citrus and some yeast. Clean, crust and not too much fizz. Very much like the Vedett white. Definitely drinkable.</p>

  Two Captains IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy, dark copper with thing head and good lacing. Smells of resinous hops. Smooth and full mouthfeel. Good American-style hopping with flowery and resinous notes, which stad out in the finish. Worryingly drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  American Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed for Morrison’s. This is a very nice, clean and sharp US-style pale ale. Dominated by hop bitterness, especially in the finish. Some bittersweet and biscuit notes and a massively long finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bishops Farewell ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very light with a frothy head. Strange, unidentifiable smell, perhaps toast and jam. Mild hop bitterness with a touch of fruit. The hops give it a lingering, refreshing dryness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

  Oakham Citra ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a slightly hazy, bubbly white head. Aroma of citrus (grapefruit) hops with some floweriness. Not too strongly hopped, with fruitiness and a lingering grapefruit dryness. Surprisingly subtle for a single-hop ale, which serves to make it very drinkable.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Dark copper. Smells of fruity, dry hops. Clean and hoppy with a nice dryness and good levels of hopping.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Surprisingly clear for a weissbier, maybe filtered. Pale with a small white head. Little aroma, but a very pleasing citrus/hop dryness and bitterness. Very drinkable, smooth and refreshing. Perhaps a little undercarbonated, but it’s a cask ale so I shouldn’t really complain.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Oldell’s 90/- ★★
  </span>
  <br />Lightly hazy copper colour with slightly off-white head. Smells malty with a very sinus-clearing almost minty kick. Sine fizz, and not a huge amount of initial taste, although a little spice comes through. Dry, fruity and spicy finish with a little caramel.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  Hop Mountain ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with a very small head. Smells hoppy and well-balanced. Taste is full and malty with hop undertones, leading to a nice, drying hop finish. Fruity rather than massively resinous hops.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Oak Barrel Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with a small, tan head. Lots of roast coffee notes. Very smooth with some bitternes and spice, along with some tannins from the barrel ageing. Slightly astringent finish. Can’t really taste the vanilla that’s meant to be in it, but it’s certainly no loss.</p>

  <br />Very light for a bitter, apparently made with lager malts. Light in colour with a few bubbles and a small, quickly vanishing white head. Floral and citrus aroma with some hops.

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Salvator ★★
  </span>
  <br />Definitely a doppelbock. Hazy golden with no head. Dark druid and sweet alcohol (and plums?) in the aroma. Malt and alcohol in the taste, with a sticky, sugary sweetness. Doesn’t really do enough for the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Peerless</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Gran Riserva ★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly red golden beer with a good head. Some hops in the aroma. Taste is quite biscuity with a hop finish. It’s better than the Nastro Azzuro, but not enough to justify the extra money.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Nastro Azzuro ★★
  </span>
  <br />Average continental lager, very pale and not too fizzy. It’s quite drinkable, but probably only if you’re in Pizza Express and there’s nothing else.</p>

  Wobbly Bob ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear, reddish brown with a faint white head. Smells sweet with bready notes, almost butterscotch. Very sweet for a bitter, with toffee and a hint of hops in the finish. Surprising and surprisingly drinkable - the hops just about balance the sweetness.</p>

  Headless ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with fine streams of carbonation with a very large, white head (I suspect that the name is ironic). Smells hoppy with floral notes. Quite fizzy with plenty of hops. Clean a drinkable. A nicely refreezing beer that you could drink all day.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Shakespeare Stout ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />At 8 a (large) bottle, I was hoping for something special and this didn’t disappoint! Has been World Stout Champion, and it’s clear why. Pours jet black, with a creamy brown (darker than tan) head, which lasts well. Smells of hops and spices, with a hint of burnt coffee. Creamy, but not as full a mouthfeel as some stouts. Contrasts with the pour, which is surprisingly fizzy. Very well rounded, with roasted malts and a nicely balancing bitter, dry aftertaste from the hops. Some berry notes. Surprisingly clean for a stout, which leads to it being incredibly drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St. Rogue Red Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper/dark brown with a light brown, tight head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some bittersweet notes leading to a dry, almost powdery finish. Needs another drink to go with it; much like a dry cider. Some fruit notes appear as it warms up a bit. Interesting, but I’m not sure I’d want to drink a whole one.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Yellow Snow ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with a white, frothy head and good lacing. Strong aroma of resinous hops. Flavour is similar with resin and some mustiness, and a lingering bitterness in the finish. Not at all subtle, but a good hit of hops. Definitely a US-style IPA.</p>

  Brain’s Party Popper ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a small white head. Smells slightly malty, but not a lot happening. Tastes quite sweet with a little fruit. Not as full as I’d expect from a winter ale. Reminiscent of a half-decent homebrew.</p>

  Drop ‘O the Black Stuff ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very black, as the name suggests. Tight tan head. Smells of roasted malt. Tastes like a porter should, with roasted malt and a little coffee, although it’s much lighter in body than I’d have expected. Enough going on to keep it interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Saint Archer Pale Ale ★★★★

  </span>
  <br />Golden with bubbles of white head. Citrus and tropical fruit in the aroma, certainly plenty of hops. Quite thin in the mouth, but plenty of flavour; more hops with both fruit and some drying bitterness, especially in the finish. Very lingering finish. Nothing amazingly new, but it does it so well. A great example of an IPA, and incredibly drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pacifica IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a foamy white head. Aroma has light hop notes. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth. Slightly mixed flavour with citrus fruits and some sweetness. Ok, but a little bit off-key. Decent bitter finish though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Raspberry Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Bright golden, smells of raspberry, which is a good start considering the name. Good tingle in the mouth, but not a whole lot of flavour. Very light with a slight raspberry bitterness in the finish. Would be a nice beer garden beer on a hot day.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Almost black with a tan head which has fairly good retention. Smell is sweet caramel with roasted malts. Bittersweet taste with bitter chocolate and sweet caramel, backed up by roasted malts. Nicely full mouthfeel. Some slight alcohol notes in the finish. The only reason this doesn’t get 5 is because the Oatmeal Stout is out of this world.</p>

  Samuel Smith’s Nut Brown Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale brown in colour (think Newcastle Brown), very clear with little head. Smells sweet, with a distinct nuttiness. Genuinely tastes of nuts, along with some sweetness and mild hops. Tingles on the tongue, but not unpleasantly so. A good brown ale, but for some reason not very exciting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Samuel Smith’s Oatmeal Stout ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a large tan head which lingers nicely. Aroma is complex, dominated by roasted malts and a notable oat smell (porridge?), some sweet caramel and bitter chocolate, also some hops. Tastes very dark, with notable oatiness. A hint of chocolate, with the bitterness and sweetness perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is full and quite thick with oats and a breadiness. This really is an excellent beer.</p>

  <br />Bright copper colour with a foamy white head. Some hops in the aroma, and maybe a little candy sugar. Dryish mouthfeel with some sweet malt follows by biscuity malt and a hop bitterness. Some dryness in the finish. Clean and drinkable, but somehow I was hoping for more from Sam Smiths.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Samuel Smith’s Organic Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden colour with foamy head. Some citrus noted, along with yeast and floral hops. Taste combines pale malts and bitter hops, with some fruitiness. Mildly bitter followthrough. Nice mouthfeel. This is very drinkable, although not exceptional.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Samuel Smith’s Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Not the Old Brewery Pale Ale, a new one. Light copper with no appreciable head. Lots of fizz. Some light malt in the aroma. Bittersweet and well balanced, but perhaps too fizzy. May be better on draught.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Samuel Smith’s Pure Brewed Lager ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber, with a small, but lasting white head. Clean lager smell, with a little malt and hops. Some malt and and a slight hop bitterness in the taste. Cleanish aftertaste, with a lingering dryness. A bit too generic-lagery to be with the price, but drinkable nevertheless.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Samuel Smith’s Strawberry ★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed in conjunction with Melbourne Brothers. Golden and slightly hazy, smells of red lace sweets, strawberry Haribo, or cheap orange jelly. Flavour is strawberry, with a slight sourness. I couldn’t drink a pint of it, but it’s not an awful fruit beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Samuel Smith’s Taddy Porter ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours very dark with little head but plentiful lacing. Smells like a classic porter, chocolate aromas with roasted malts and a little hops. Silky smooth mouthfeel with espresso notes and a nice complexity. Incredibly well balanced with sweetness and bitter roasted malts / hops. Nice roasted aftertaste. This should be the benchmark for all porters.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Samuel Smith’s Winter Welcome Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a fine, tight white head. Very clear. Pretty fizzy mouthfeel with malt and some medium-dry hops. Drinkable but not inspiring.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Samuel Smith’s Yorkshire Stingo ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown, with lots of carbonation. No head. Smells of alcohol, raisins and port. Malt flavours dominate, with a little oak and an alcohol tingle. There’s also some dark fruit and a little perfuminess. Lingering spicy bitterness. Warming, but surprisingly warm mouthfeel.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Sarah Hughes</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dark Ruby ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, ruby beer, with a rich blackcurrant smell. Very complex, fruity but not too sweet. Nice, contrasting dry finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Scarborough</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Scarborough Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark colour. Smells quite light. Also tastes quite light and thin for a stout. Think spicy mild/porter and that’s what this is. Pretty good, but loses out as it’s not really a stout in my book.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Scheldebrouwerij</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  De Zeezuiper ★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy light gold with a thick white head. Smells of candy sugar and perfume. Taste is heavy on the alcohol but not a lot else. A bit too generic.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dulle Griet ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with a slight tinge of red, and very slightly off-white head. Smells of red wine or port. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, with a definite alcohol kick. Some dark malt, but not a huge amount going on other than a bit of spice. Better as it warms up.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lamme Goedzak ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy amber with a thin foam of white head. Smells typically Belgian with some sweetness and yeast. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Tastes like a cross between Leffe and a gueuze, with quite a full rounded mouthfeel and a dry, almost tart finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Oesterstout ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a red hue and off-white head. Smells porty with some sweetness and fruit. Taste has roasted malt with a light bitterness, definite alcohol notes and some sweetness. Also some light coffee/mocha and dark fruit. Somehow doesn’t really hang together.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Straffe Toebackk ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a small finger of white head. Smells sweet and alcoholic with a bit of floweriness. Taste is also quite sweet, perhaps too sweet and too strong.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Schlenkerla</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy orange with a thin beige head. Very smokey aroma, just like a camp fire, with bacon notes. Mouthfeel is a little greasy. Taste is dominated by the smoke, but not so much as their normal rauchbier. Some grassiness and hops with some sweetness from the malt. ABV is well hidden. Definitely one to drink cold, otherwise the smokiness is overpowering.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Aecht Schlenkerla Märzen ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber, with some reddish notes. Aroma is like a camp fire. Smokiness dominates the taste, but there’s a little sweet malt as well. Smokiness is overpowering if it warms up, but it’s a very interesting beer and well worth trying.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Aecht Schlenkerla Weizen ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark copper colour with a small, fine white head. Smells very much of a campfire. QUite a fizzy mouthfeel, which is good as the tingle cuts through the smokiness, which then reappears in the long finish. Plenty of malt body to back up the smoke as well.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Fastenbier ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy reddish brown with good off-white head. Definite smokey aroma. Well balanced with smoke, malt sweetness, some dark fruit and a nice bitterness in the finish. A bit smoother and better balanced than the other smoked beers.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Schwabenbrau</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Das Helle ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden, no fizz and a creamy white head. Smells slightly grassy and sweet, as a helles should. A little fizzy. Generally clean and drinkable, with lots of grass notes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Scottish and Newcastle</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  John Smiths Extra Smooth ★★
  </span>
  <br />Cold, bland, very poor smoothflow beer. The only reason it doesn’t get a 1 is that there are (unfortunately) many far worse beers around.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Settle</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Settle Classic ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden. Slightly fruity/flowery aroma. Quite hoppy taste, and a nice bit of sourness. Pretty drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Severn Vale</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Severn Sins ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very black. Lots of roasted malts with an accompanying dryness. A bit watery and not rounded enough.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Sharp’s</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Doom Bar ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber in colour, with small white head. Aroma is almost entirely caramek and malt. Medium carbonation, quite flavoursome, particularly malts with a full mouthfeel. Nothing ground-breaking but a good, drinkable, session ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Red Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddy-bronze with a small, slightly off-white head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Light roasted flavour with some sweetness and a a little dry hops to balance it up.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sea Fury ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Roasted (light) aroma with some fruitiness. Taste is quite full with red fruit/berry notes. Pretty clean but with a slight stickiness in the finish. A decent strong bitter (first brewed in 1996, but tastes like a modern craft ale)</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Seven Souls ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Chocolate and coffee notes dominate she aroma. Well rounded with a spicy bitterness and similar flavours to the aroma. Very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Shepherd Neame</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  1698 Celebration Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light brown/amber with a large creamy head. Smells of roasted malts, with some zestyness from the hops. Bittersweet flavour with medium body. Not hugely exciting, but worryingly drinkable considering the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Artesian Light Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with foamy white head. Biscuit malt with citrus hops in the aroma. Similar taste. Clean and light. Good session beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bishops Finger ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear amber with an off white head. Smells of bready male with some hops and perhaps nuts. Hops are pretty dominant, but there’s some malt as well. Well balanced. Drinkable, but a little unexciting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Brilliant Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden. Dominated by slightly bitter hops and a bit of fizz. Refreshing but definitely noticeable alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Canterbury Jack ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a frothy white head. Light malt and some hops in the aroma. Taste is clean, with a little vegetation, backed up by a strong hop finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Early Bird ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden amber, with an off-white head. Smells of hops and citrus, maybe with a little grass. Taste is all hops, with lots of bitterness, which possibly goes a bit too far. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Very drinkable for a pint, but could get a bit bitter in the long run.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Late Red ★★
  </span>
  <br />Rust red/brown colour. Pours fizzy with a finger of head, Smells of hopes with some grapefruit and spicy notes. Quite complicated taste and somewhat dry, somewhat too fizzy. Some sourness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  London Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a small, tan head. Smells and tastes of sweet roasted malt. Finish is quite dry and bitter, which keeps it interesting. Pretty good.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Master Brewer Choice ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper coloured. Bittersweet aroma and taste. It’s OK.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rudolph’s Reward ★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a light chestnut ale. Some fruit in the nose. It’s pretty generic with a slightly bitter, hoppy finish. Thankfully the name is as Christmassy as it gets!</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Spitfire ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Downed all over Kent; just like the Luftwaffe. Auburn, with a thin head. Spicy, bitter taste follows a deceptively sweet smell. Not bad at all, a good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Sun Lik ★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks like fizzy lager. Large, frothy white head. Quite sweet and grainy with a little bitterness. OK for a commercial lager.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Whitechapel Porter (Asda) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark ruby colour with a creamy tan head. Smells of roasted malt and coffee. Taste is quite bitter, with roasted malt. Let down by the mouthfeel, it’s too fizzy and feels a bit astringent.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Shepherd Neame (ASDA)</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Gentleman Jack ★★
  </span>
  <br />Tawny colour. Pours very fizzy with a bubbly white head. Little aroma. Very fizzy mouthfeel with little taste, perhaps some nuttiness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mainbrace IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with large, frothy white head. Quite dry but with a malty sweetness and a lingering dry hop finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Shepherd Neame (for Sainsbury’s)</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Traditional Kentish Alse ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown, with a foamy, slightly off-white head. Smells hoppu with a little light malt. Tastes similar with a hop dryness in the aftertaste. Average.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Shilling Brewing Co</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Unicorn IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orange-golden with small foamy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Good mix malt and bitter hops with a lingering finish. Definitely a British IPA rather than an American one…</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Ruthless Rye IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Certainly doesn’t capture the ‘pale’ part of an IPA. Copper, with a bubbly, white head. Light aroma of American hops. Rounded mouthfeel with a cutting edge of resinous hops. Good citrus bitterness in the finish, along with some dryness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sierra Nevada Kellerweiss ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very hazy, almost opaque. Golden with a very small, sparse white head. A litle lemony citrus in the aroma, along with some sweetness. Smooth mouthful, with a little tingle. Quite sharp at the start, followed by a little malt and then more sharp dryness on the edge of the tongue. A little too gassy and sour to be anything better than drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Sierra Nevada Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden orange colour with a white lacy head. Smells of hops and flowers with a lot of citrus as well. Maybe a little grain. Crisp with an initial malt taste followed by plenty of hop bitterness. Nicely rounded with a citrus finish. Very drinkable; I wish it came in bigger bottles.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sierra Nevada Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with a tan head. Smells of roasted malt with some burnt sourness. Fizzy mouthfeel, very dry with some chocolate. Mouthfeel is a lot thinner than I’d expect from a porter, and the fizziness is somewhat distracting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sierra Nevada Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Similar to the porter, with slightly less fizz and a bit more of a rounded taste and mouthfeel. Still not brilliant though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Sierra Nevada Torpedo ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a frothy white head, which quickly disappears. Smells of pine and citrus hops. A very hoppy taste with a pleasing bitterness. Moderate carbonation ensures it’s very drinkable. A very powerfully hopped IPA, think their Pale Ale ramped up to 11.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Silhill</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Russian Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy amber with quite a large head. Smells of light malt with some sweetness and light fruits. Taste is moderately bitter, quite smooth with little carbonation. Slight bitter aftertaste. Decent session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Siren</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Broken Dreams Breakfast Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with tan head. Loads of roasted malt. Pretty fizzy in the mouth. Not a massive amount of flavour, some roasted malt and dry hops.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pompelmocello ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Grapefruit IPA. Hazy yellow with a huge grapefruit aroma. It’s definitely a sir I braider beer rather than a sweet one. Some malt in the body. Decent but didn’t excite me.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Six Bells</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Blob On ★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks like a generic bitter. Tastes like a very thin generic bitter.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Six Degrees North</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Chopper ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with creamy, off-white head. Dark and roasted malt aroma, with light smoke notes. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Light roast and bitterness. It’s a decent stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hopclassic ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy bright yellow with fine white head. Loads of bitter, citrus hops in the aroma, along with some yeast notes. Very bitter with a drying finish that has hints of citrus.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Ska Brewery</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Modus Hoperandi ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of citrus and pine hops with grapefruit notes. Taste is as expected, bitter and hoppy, but not too extreme. Has a lovely, lingering hop finish. A hugely excellent IPA, and probably the best canned beer I’ve ever had. In fact, it’s better out of the can than out of a glass.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Vernal Minthe Stout ★★
  </span>
  <br />Frothy brown head. Tastes of mint, vanilla and coffee, with chocolate notes. Odd but not undrinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Skinners</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Betty Stoggs ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with a small white head. Little aroma. Very clean taste but not a lot going on at all. An ok session beer if there’s nothing more exciting on offer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hunny Bunny ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden copper colour. Small white head. Slightly sweet aroma. Some honey sweetness and a little flowery hop, along with light malt. Crisp finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Skinner’s Cornish Knocker ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden ale, smells of hops and some (dark?) malts. Some hop dryness, which is quite subtle. Very drinkable, with a long, dry finish with some citrus. Not overly exciting though.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Slater’s</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Columbia Coffee Stout ★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with a large, white, creamy head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Quite odd tasting with a bitterness and some vegetable and mineral notes. No real identifiable coffee flavour.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Scorcher ★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale, with a little fruit, otherwise a bit dull. Not as summery and refreshing as I would have expected.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Top Totty ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with good hop aroma and taste with some bitterness. Nicely drinkable but nothing special.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Why Knot ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with a foamy white head. Smells very bitter, almost to the point of being sour. Tastes a lot better but still berry bitter. Has a good tingle; it’s almost like drinking a pint of limbic. Not sure this is what they were aiming for.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Slaughterhouse</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Pacific Pale Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a white head. Smells musty and tastes stale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />More golden than pale in colour. Small white head. Smells of light, sweet malt. A hop bitterness with a nice dryness and perhaps some fruit in a lingering finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Saddleback ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with little head. Smells a bit sour with some sweetness. Tastes slightly burnt and nutty with some sourness. Like a gone-off brown ale. Significantly better on tap.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Saddleback ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear amber colour. Smells of caramel and roasted malt. Taste is similar with some bread notes and floral hop. Bitter and roasted, dry finish. Good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Swinehead ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden in colour with a small white head. Smells wheaty. Very smooth with a hint of lemon.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Third Degree ★
  </span>
  <span class="beers_abv">5.0%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">Black Ale</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />You can tell a lot about a brewery by their ability to make a good (or not) black IPA. This fails spectacularly! Smells and tastes like TCP.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Wild Boar ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with no head. Some malts and a little burnt, but not particularly interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Sleeman Brewery</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Spring Special ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with a very fine white head. Like a golden/pale ale with a bit of malt and some sweetness. A good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Sonnet 43</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  American Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden. Supposed to have a lot of hops, but actually, other than fragrant hops, it’s missing something and becomes a bit boring. However, it’s certainly drinkable and doesn’t make the mistake of being an over-hopped American pale ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  The Raven ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with light brown head. Lots of roasted malt aroma. Quite sweet with a full, roast finish. Hints of bourbon. Pretty drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">South Hams</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Pandemonium ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown. Smells chemically, with some antiseptic notes. Taste is similarly odd. Somehow it’s not completely undrinkable though.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Southern Tier</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Southern Tier Imperial Mokah ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pitch black with a rapidly-vanishing tan head. Smells (unsurprisingly) of hot chocolate. Slightly bitter with some definite mocha notes and an oily mouthfeel. Tastes nothing like it’s ABV would suggest, you could certainly drink a lot of these. On the down side, the flavour is nowhere near as strong or exciting as the aroma suggests.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Southport</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Golden Sands ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Apparently this is triple hopped with citrus hops. Weirdly it tastes like pizza base with olive oil and tomato. Having said that, I’d certainly have another.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Spaten-Franziskaner-Brau</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Hefe-Weisse ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy dark amber, as a weissbier should be. Large, frothy white head. Aroma is banana esters with some clove spiciness. Crisp carbonation and a full mouthfeel. Taste is citrus, with some wheat banana notes. Finishes with good spicing and a little dry hops. A good fruity weissbier.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Oktoberfest ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear, very pale gold colour, with more head than the other Oktoberfests. Some more yeast in the taste, but quite clean. Less fizzy mouthfeel and a more vegetable taste. A bit thin.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Speights</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Distinction Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A dark lager. Sweet, caramel aroma and similar taste with some hop bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Gold Medal Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with aroma of grass and hops. Taste is similar. Somewhere between a pale ale and a lager.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mid Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid in colour as in name. Some caramel sweetness balanced malt and some hops. Drinkable and you don’t notice the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old Dark ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with small off-white head. Roasted malt and a hint of chocolate in the aroma. Well balanced and drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Red-black. Rich and full tasting with a light smokey note on top of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Summit ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden. Clean tasting with a little hop bitterness. It’s a light lager.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Triple Hop Pilsner ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden. Smells of grassy malt and hops with some citrus notes. Taste is similar - it’s essentially a textbook pils.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Sperrin</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Victory Third Party ★★
  </span>
  <br />Surely a bit high ABV for a mild? Dark brown. Smells dirty and has very little taste. This one’s not really a winner.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Spey Valley</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Spey Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with bubbles of brown head. Slightly metallic with roasted notes. Clean and drinkable with a bit of fizz in the mouth.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Speyside</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dava Way EPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />An elderflower pale ale. Orange-golden with sticky white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Very clean with earthy and slightly spicy elderflower notes, especially in the lingering finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Snowflake Mountain ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy dark brown with off-white white head. Some sweetness and spices in the aroma. Big flavours with sweet maltiness and some winter spices. Lingering finish with much the same.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Springhead</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Puritans Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with a creamy white head. Smells of sweet roasted malts. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel with some roasted flavour, generally quite dry.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Robin Hood Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper bitter, with a small white head. Some fruit and sourness in the nose. Taste is mainly hops. Smooth, but not a lot going on other than a bitter hop finish with some dryness. Nevertheless, very drinkable.</p>

  <br />Dark red, no real head. Smells of (burnt) roasted malt with a little sweetness. Taste is similar, especially the burnt notes. Apparently a Trappist-style beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Squark</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Crex ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy orange/gold with tight white head. Citrus hop aroma with some bitterness. Very smooth with orange and a light bitterness. Very drinkable; could maybe do with a little more bite, either through bitterness or fizz.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">St Andrews</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Blindside Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with a foamy off-white head. Smell and taste are what you’d expect from a coffee stout. Plenty of roast notes and some bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Bow Fiddle Blonde. ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Straw coloured with floral and citrus aroma. Citrus dominates with lime and grapefruit. Quite bitter and drying. However, very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Crail Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with rapidly vanishing bubbly white head. Fruity, slightly citrus nose. Quite fizzy in the mouth. Not a huge amount going on other than some lemon and a bitter finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Eighty Bob ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with lots of bubbles and a rapidly vanishing white head. Some caramel sweetness and malt in the aroma. Quite fizzy. Not a huge amount going on other than a bittersweet finish. Distinctly OK.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Mocha Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with brown, bubbly head. Aroma and taste are mostly coffee with some roasted malt. Very well-rounded and easy to drink. Pleasant coffee, bitter finish with a touch of sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">St Austell</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  1913 Original Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, with quite a fizzy pour and a brown fizz that doesn’t leave any head. Smells lightly of roasted malt. Slightly fizzy in the mouth. Packed with roast malt, coffee and chocolate with a richness and a nice, lingering bitter finish. A very nice stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Admiral’s Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper ale, with a thin white head. Aroma of grapefruit and malt. Taste has a slight caramel maltiness, clean with a slightly dry aftertaste. Smooth, but perhaps a little too oily.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Clouded Yellow ★★
  </span>
  <br />Cornish Weissbier, spoilt by the addition of strong vanilla flavour. Smells of vanilla and coriander. Very light in colour, very fizzy both in the glass and on the tongue. Spicy, vanilla, with lasting creamy malts, banana, and yet more vanilla.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cornish Bock ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper-gold with a large, frothy white head. Smells sweet and alcoholic. Taste is similar with a little hopping. A good imitation of a German bock. Quite fizzy, but that’s probably to be expected.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cousin Jack ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with very small head. Aroma of citrus, although nothing massive. Taste is very similar. Clean and drinkable but nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dartmoor ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with a tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. A little malt and bitterness and a bit of fruit sweetness give a good rounded mouthful. Nothing special though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  HSD Hicks Special Draught ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark, copper colour with no appreciable head. Smells malty, with a slight sweetness. Tastes darker than it looks, with roasted malts and a hop kick, followed by a roasted aftertaste. Very nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Korev ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cornish lager. Pale gold in colour. Smells light and lagery, with a little sweetness. Not too fizzy, which is a good thing. Pretty crisp and clean with a lingering sweetness and grass notes. Ok, but not as good as a good helles.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Proper Black ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A black IPA. Very dark, no appreciable head. Smells of fruit (apricot/fruit gums) with not a lot of fizz. Quite smooth taste. Some burnt notes, roasted malt and coffee. Some bitter, burnt toast notes with plenty of hops in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Proper Job ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden colour with a small white head. Smells of grapefruit/citrus, quite complex. Some biscuity malt, but dominated by hops, which linger to the finish. Lovely, dry and bitter. Very drinkable, would probably be excellent with a curry.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Royal Diamond ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy, dark golden, with a large frothy head. Strong, well-rounded hop aroma. Some alcohol notes which merge into a clean, resinous finish. Also some sweetness. Plenty going on, but it’s well-balanced and very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Smuggler’s Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Quite a dark copper colour, and quite fizzy. Apparently contains coriander, but it’s not really noticable amongst the complicated combination of malts, sour fruit and bitterness. Complicated, but reasonably drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Smuggler’s Grand Cru ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper/bronze with a small, slightly off-white head around the side of the glass. Quite bitter, with some sweet notes and a huge alcohol kick. Definitely not a session beer, and probably overpowered to be honest.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Trelawny ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper ale, with off-white head. Smells of fruit (peach/apricot) hops. Flavour is fruity malt with caramel. Finish is dry and bitter. Good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Tribute ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Deep amber colour with little head. Some fruity bitterness in the aroma. Taste is sweet malts and refreshing hops. Dry aftertaste makes this very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tribute Extra ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with no head. Citrus, zesty aroma. Clean and very drinkable with a little bitterness and some biscuit malt. Bitter hop finish builds. Nothing like Tribute, but very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">St Peter’s</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  G-Free ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with large bubbles of carbonation but no real head. Smells grainy. Clean-tasting with a nice bitterness in the finish. A perfectly good pint of light ale, which doesn’t seem to suffer from being gluten free.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Grapefruit ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, no real head. Smells (unsurprisingly) of grapefruit with a little light malt. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is clean and refreshing with citrus mainly in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Old-Style Porter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks pretty much exactly like a pint of coke, albeit with slightly less fizz. Smells sweet as well, with a little toasted malts. Creamy mouthfeel, with a nice level of carbonation. Well balanced, some caramel and roasted coffee.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Organic Best Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper, with a small head. Smells very malty. Nice rounded taste, and not too fizzy. Some hops in the finish. Very drinkable at the start, but gets a bit dull.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Plum Porter ★
  </span>
  <span class="beers_abv">5.0%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">Fruit Beer</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />Looks fine - very dark with a small, brown head. Huge, sickly-sweet aroma (like the filing of cream chocolates), presumably the fruity notes are plum. Flavour is similarly ‘forward’, with loads of sweetness and some spice in the finish, but dominated by sugar. It’s an alcopop porter.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St Peter’s Mild ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Nearly black with a foamy, tan head. Come ruby hues and good lacing. Strong aroma of very roasted, almost burnt malt with a coffee bitterness. Slight carbonation, with a very full mouthfeel. However, actually ends up quite watery. Some roasted flavour but not a lot else going on.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St Peter’s Summer Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with very small white head. A few fine streams of carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is slightly spicy with a little prickle of fizz in the mouth.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St Peter’s Wheat Beer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden/copper with a good finger of white head. Smells slightly dirty. Quite dry with lots of wheat in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  St Peters IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden / light copper with a rocky white head. Lots of drying and slightly bitter hops. A little fizz, finished off by a nie drying hop flavour.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Suffolk Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden. Smells grainy with some light hopping. Actually tastes a lot darker than it looks. OK, but nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Suffolk Gold ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a fluffy white head. Smells of light malt. Very well-rounded with malt in the start and a nice, lingering bitter finish. Nice summer beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Summer Ale ★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">St. Georgen Brau</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Buttenheim Doppelbock ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown, frothy, slightly off-white head. Smells sweet and string with some roasted malt. Quite smooth and flat mouthfeel, with a little roasted malt. No real hops or bitterness, but still pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Buttenheim Kellerbier ★★
  </span>
  <br />Had this at the beer tasting and two bottles we tried were very variable. This is the review for the nicer one. Medium brown, slightly hazy. Large foamy white head. Smells quite clean and is reasonably well balanced – nicely malty with a bit of fruit. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">St. Georges</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dragon’s Blood ★★★★

  Rudyard Ruby Premium ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with no head. Smells of roasted malt and dark fruit. Mouthfeel is fizzy and thin. Tastes roasted and burnt, with slight toffee notes. Very average, but nothing really wrong with it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Stanley Green</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddish gold - not all that pale. Very well balanced combination of hops with good bitterness backed up by some fruity notes. Exceptionally drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Stella Artois</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Stella Artois ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear, pale gold with aroma of grain and some sweetness. Mild sweet taste with a slight sharpness. Definitely not one of the best Belgian beers.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Stevens Point Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Point Belgian White ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy light golden with little head. Smells and tastes like a wit, but quite a light one with a touch of citrus. Nice, but not overly exciting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Point Belgian White ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy light golden, small, tight white head.  Some sticky sweetness in the aroma and taste.  Some banana and very light spicing. Like a tinned weissbier.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Stewart’s</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Black IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with frothy white head. Lots of fruity hops in the aroma and taste. A good bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cauld Reekie ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with small tan head. Light roasted notes. Very smooth with some alcohol notes and light roast flavour. Worryingly quaffable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dakota ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with off-white head. Quite bitter, but not necessarily in a good way. It’s a dark brown ale, and not brilliant, but drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Edinburgh Festival ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with tight, creamy white head. Smells of sweet malt with some grain notes. Taste is bready with some hop bitterness. Like a mainstream IPA such as Greene King. OK.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with small white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some grain notes, maybe a little hop. Taste is similar. Probably a good session ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Major Hall’s Brew ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with white head. It’s very reminiscent of Citra, with plenty of citrus hops and a nice, clean finish. ABV is pretty low for an IPA, but it makes this a very good session beer, with enough fruity bitterness to keep it interesting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pentland IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, small patchy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. taste is mostly bitter hops. A bit thin but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  Engelszell Gregorius Trappistenbier ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark. Smells dark with spice and a slight medicine aroma. Taste is similar with a stickiness in the finish. Can’t place the smell, although there’s some sweetness and spice mixed in there somewhere. Definitely a sipping beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Cohort ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Described as a double black Belgian rye pale ale. Very dark with a large frothy brown head. Smells of resinous hops. Lots of fizz in the mouth. Grass (presumably rye) notes.hop bitterness and some roast malts in the finish. Doesn’t smell like it looks or taste like it smells, but this is a very nice hoppy beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dambusters ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with a small, off-white head. Very dry aroma, with some coffee notes. Light bodied, yet very well balanced with good bitterness of hops and roasted malts. Nice long finish and very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Diablo ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy gold with a small, white head. Smells of tropical fruit hops. Astringently hopped with lots of bitterness and no real attempt at balance; it’s just hops, hops and more hops. Lots of resinous pine in the finish. Definitely not for everyone, but I really liked it.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lime and Coriander Saison ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with fine streams of carbonation and a very large, very frothy head. Not a huge amount of aroma gets past the head; maybe some citrus notes. Some sourness and spice, with a bitter finish. Not as different or inventive as I thought it was going to be.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Maelstrom ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy copper with virtually no head. Smells very hoppy with citrus and some resin notes. Loads of very dry hops leading to a slight smokiness and a strongly lingering dry, resinous, and slightly sticky aftertaste.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Very strong smell, alcohol mixed with complex fruit aroma, combined with sweetish, yet sour coffee notes. Spicy, alcoholic coffee taste, with a bit of fizz, and a very strong alcohol aftertaste. Well balance, yet complex, but the alcohol taste stops it being as drinkable as I’d like.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Jet black with huge, tight, frothy tan head. Smells great with some citrus fruit and sweetness. Full bodied with a good bitterness that leads to chocolate and a refreshing resin hop note. Very nice.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with small, bubbly white head. Floral, fruity hop aroma. Taste is dominated by hops. Very refreshing with a light but lingering dry and resinous hop finish.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Dark amber with lots of bubbles and a bubbly white head that leaves sticky lacing. Earthy aroma with some resin pine notes. Sweet, biscuity Taste leading to a good hop bitterness. Also some orange notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Saison Du Pomme ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with some large bubbles of carbonation and a rapidly-vanishing white, bubbly head.  Nice gooseberry aroma with some peppery, Belgian yeast notes.Taste is quite dry with some alcohol and an oily finish. Some cider-like notes. Quite sweet. Complex but a bit weird.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Unforgiven ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown with small, tight, slightly off-white head.  Smells unsurprisingly smokey. Taste is nicely smoked without being overwhelming. A very nice example of the style.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Terrapin Rye ★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rugbrød ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Reddy-brown with white foam on the edge of the glass. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste has some alcohol and sweetness, and also sourness. Somehow it’s a bit flat. The bottom of the bottle (with yeast) tasted better.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pilsner ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Tastes quite sweet with some spice and bitter, but not too bitter, hops. Matches well with the aroma. Far more taste than I expected from a pilsner. Nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  XS ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with no head. Smells strong and rich with some hop undertones, which give it a floral nature. Taste is rich and complex with a full, malty mouthfeel followed by sharp, hop bitterness, which lingers and develops into a slight floral/fruitiness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  ANR India Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy (bottle conditioned) orange-brown with no head and a few spots of carbonation on the surface. Smells of American hops, mostly orange citrus but with some bitterness.

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Columbus India Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy (bottle conditioned) orange-brown with no head and a few spots of carbonation on the surface. Slightly lighter hopping than the ANR, but again orange and grapefruit citrus notes. Fizzier mouthfeel with a more rounded, slightly sour citrus flavour. Again, some sweetness, but mostly dry grapefruit, especially in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  </span>
  <br />Pretty much black with a creamy, tan head. Smells of coffee and roast malts, with some bitterness. Quite fizzy in the mouth. Malty coffee with some bitterness and hops in the finish. Some slightly burnt notes.</p>

  <br />Very black with a small, patchy tan head. Lots of chocolate and roasted malt with coffee and some sweetness in the aroma. Slight fizz and a very full mouthfeel, which is smooth with plenty going on. Roasted coffee with some bitterness that lingers in the finish. Also some smoke.

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  India Double Porter Citra Ella ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with tan head that disappears relatively quickly. Roasted aroma with alcohol notes. Taste is similar, but holds up well to the ABV. Plenty of roasted flavours, full mouthfeel and a bitter hop finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  India Pale Ale Mosaic ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy orange. Smells of tropical fruit hops. A little carbonation. Loads of pineapple and resinous notes. A clean and very drinkable IPA.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Table Beer ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden in colour. Smells of tropical fruit hops. Lovely mix of hops. Very complex, with deep resinous, dry flavours backed up by tropical fruit. Lingering hop bitter dryness in the finish. Especially good when you consider the low ABV. Would be a truly excellent session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">The Lade Inn</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ladeout ★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">The Open Gate</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Citra IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a white head. Quite a grainy aroma with some light citrus hops. Taste is mostly malt. Despite the marketing, it’s much more like an English IPA than an American one. Nothing special.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Theakston</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Barista Stout ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />This is genuinely what a coffee stout should be. Very dark with creamy, off -white head. Loads of coffee and chocolate aroma. Taste is basically espresso and stout. You definitely get what you ordered! Well balanced, beer smooth, and a slight roasted bitterness in the finish. Benefits from being served a little bit cooler than a cask ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Bull Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Standard bitter colour, but surprisingly tingly mouthfeel. Slightly bitter, as you’d expect. Tastes very similar to Theakstons normal bitter.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Lightfoot ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very light in colour, lots of fizz in the pour leading to a large white head. Smells like a light Belgian blonde. Taste is light and refreshing with some citrus. Lightly hopped, and a very good summer beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  AM:PM ★★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bayern ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Yeah. It’s a pils. Fairly generic but drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Chiron ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with some bubbles of white head. Light hop aroma (possibly citra). Taste is also quite light with enough hops to make it a very drinkable session beer. More hops come through as it warms up. Deceptively dangerous.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Colorado Red ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Red with very small off-white head. Smells of chocolate. Cocoa and really resinous hops. Quite surprising but actually works OK.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Halcyon ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a good, white head but no real lacing. Definite hop aroma. Tingle on the tongue. Lots of hops, tropical fruit, grapefruit and a lingering bitterness. More peppery and resinous taste as it warms up a bit.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Jaipur IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Straw colours with a thin white head and a hint of haze from the bottle conditioning. Smells hoppy with lemon and grapefruit citrus and well as some floral and biscuit notes. Taste is similar, with a malt background and plenty of hops. Light carbonation. Quite American-IPA like with some resin. Gets a bit more bitter as it warms up.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  KMF ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with lots of grapefruit and orangey aroma. Clean and crisp with citrus and a little sweetness. Gently bitter finish. Nice, but nothing overwhelmingly special.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Kill Your Darlings ★★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Kipling ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />As you’d expect from an IPA, smells of hops and citrus. Tastes of grapefruit, nice balance of sourness and hoppy dryness. Very pale, and very drinkable. Marketed as a Pacific Pale Ale; contains nelson sauvin hops from New Zealand.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lukas ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with fine white head. Grassy aroma. Quite sweet with a little hop bitterness and quite a lot of fizz. Citrus notes in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Lumford ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with a small, bubbly white head. Smells of light malt and a bit of hops. Clean and dry with good flavourful hops in the finish. Excellent summer session beer, but nothing outstanding about it.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Saint Petersburg ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with a large, rocky white head. Smells of peaty smoke with some chocolate notes. Tastes smokey with roasted malt and a lingering pettiness. Very drinkable and doesn’t seem like it’s 7-and-a-bit percent.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tzara ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale with no carbonation and small bubbles of white head. Smells sweet and a little grassy with a bit of hop bitterness. Clean and crisp with a light tingle in the mouth. Doesn’t do a whole lot, so a good recreation of the style; not exactly a selling point, though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Versa ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orangey-golden with small patches of white head. Smells of banana and clove, as you’d expect. Smooth and wheat with a slight tingle. More banana and clove in the taste. Finish is clean and spritzy with light citrus notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Wild Swan ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Thorny Goat ★★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pond Hopper ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with a very tight white head with good lacing. Fruity hops and light resin notes in the aroma. Also smells quite alcoholic. Tastes a lot like blackcurrant chewits with a little floweriness and a drying, hoppy, tingly, slightly astringent finish. Also some peachy, white wine notes. Gets a bit too sweet after a while.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Three Boys</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Oyster Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with sticky brown head. Lots of roast malt and bitterness in the aroma. Taste has sweetness, bitterness and a surprising fruit and hop finish. Interesting and other than the roast malt doesn’t taste that dark.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Three Daggers</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Daggers Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Tastes quite sweet, almost like it wasn’t quite ready in time for the beer festival.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Three Kings</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Silver Darling ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden. Smells slightly green. However, there’s some good hop flavour. A nice pale ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Thwaites</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

  <br />Copper with small head. Loads of hops in the aroma with tropical fruit. Malty and rounded with some drying hops in the finish that build.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Chestnut Dancer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />There’s a clue to the colour in the name. Pours slightly fizzy (although not bottle conditioned). Small white head. Slight malt aroma. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, well balanced but dominated by malts.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Magic Sponge ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with creamy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Slightly creamy with little going on.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Tickety Brew</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very lively. Dark brown with large off-white head. Smells of roasted malt with some bitterness.  Full flavoured and smooth. Both bitter and sweet with a slightly roasted finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Timothy Taylor</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Landlord ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light brown with small, rapidly vanishing head. Smells of hops with some light malt. Taste is incredibly well balanced - this is a seriously drinkable beer. Some hop bitterness and sweet malt which lends it a biscuity feel. Mouthfeel is a bit light, but otherwise excellent. You could probably drink this all day.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Tintagel</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Castle Gold ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Gold, bright, with a frothy white head. Clean and hoppy. Nicely dry, and although there’s not a huge amount going on other than dry, bitter hops, it’s a very drinkable beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Graf Tan ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark winter warmer, tastes as you’d expect. Average but drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Harbour Special ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark copper. Smells quite hoppy. Nice and crisp with a good hop bitterness. Very nice, and certainly enhanced by being in a warm, dry pub rather than a Cornish hurricane.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Tiny Rebel</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Billabong ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with tight white head. Tropical fruit hop notes in the aroma. Very nice balance of fruity hops and bitterness. Interesting and very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Cereal Killer IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with small white head. Loads of American style resinous and tropical fruit hops in the aroma. Clean tasting. Not as strongly hoppy as the smell, but enough to keep it interesting and a building, hoppy finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dirty Stop Out ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with tan head. Lots of smoke in the aroma. Very smooth with obvious smoke notes but plenty of bitterness to balance. Leads to a bittersweet finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dutty ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy light yellow with a huge head that fades quickly to a rocky foam. Lots of US hops in the aroma. Clean and slightly bitter with plenty of juicy hops. A decent American (Vermont) IPA.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Titanic</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Mi Lady’s Fancy ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured with a small white head. Aroma is mostly hops and the mouthfeel is very fizzy for an ale. Slightly spicy with a dry, hoppy finish. A very nice spring beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  White Star ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Quite pale with a foamy white head and good carbonation. Floral hoppiness, with a little sourness in the aroma. Quite fizzy and bitter in the mouth, with floral hops followed by malt and then more citrusy hops. Very drinkable; certainly a good summer beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Sundancer ★★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cwrw Hf ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of citrus hops. Pale golden colour, very fizzy for an ale, with lots of big bubbles. Light and refreshing but not a huge amount going on. A nice summer session beer.</p>

  </span>
  <br />Very similar to the cask version.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Staple ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a small white head. Fresh, fruity hop aroma. Clean and quaffable. A bit thin, but would make a good summer session ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Coopers Special ★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with a small off-white head. Roasted malts and dried fruit. Not very well balanced.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Malty Towers ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden. Very malty flavour and nicely refreshing. This is a very good beer, although given the colour, I could imagine the taste is a bit of a shock if you didn’t read the name.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Track</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Toba ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark. Smells rich and roasted. Tastes similar with slight hop bitterness. Very full bodied and drinkable, with a pleasing dryness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Traquair House Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Traquair Jacobite Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Nearly black, no head to speak of. Alcohol notes accompany spices (coriander, aniseed, cinnamon), along with dark sugar/molasses. Lots of roasted malt, cut through by some bitter-sweetness and an off-putting astringency. Reminiscent of a very raw, dark rum.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Tring</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Jack O’Legs ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a froth of white head. Smells slightly bitter. Taste has plenty of hop bitterness, and is clean with a nice tingle in the mouth. Very drinkable but uninspiring.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Amarillo ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very slightly hazy golden with creamy white head. Grapefruit and orange in the aroma. a little tingle in the mouth. Quite thin and dominated by an orange and then dry grapefruit finish. Could do with more body; not very well-rounded.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Carronade ★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, smells very biscuity. Tastes very dirty. Not a good pint at all.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Double Chocolate Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with lots of chocolate aroma. Thick and creamy, with milk chocolate notes and a slightly bitter finish with more chocolate. Definitely does what it says on the label.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Tsingtao Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Tsingtao ★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden lager. Some sweet grain in the aroma, very light. Slightly too sweet taste, but goes ok with food. Still drinkable as it warms, which is a bonus.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Winter Cheer ★★
  </span>
  <br />Brown with a fine off-white head. Smells of winter spices. Taste is similar - it’s definitely a Christmas beer. It’s fine, a decent beer, but not really my thing.</p>

  <span class="beers_style">Dubbel</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">bottle</span>
  <br />Apparently this is a re-yeasted version of Quill. Dark coloured, with plenty of malt in the aroma, along with some dark fruit. Strange burnt/bitter taste at the start with an accompanying dryness. Some alcohol notes but a bit thin in the mouth.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Czech Style Black Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, small, sparse tan head. Smells very malty with some raostedness, maybe rye bread. Quite smooth, and not too much fizz. Very thin mouthfeel and taste. Some malt and a little sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Legacy ★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden brown. Very clear with a thin slick of head. Very strong aroma; smells a lot darker than it is, with a few burnt-toast notes. Some alcohol and a little sweetness. Quite flat with a roasted dryness, some sweet aftertaste. Lingering, slightly drying finish. Tastes a lot like a homebrew kit.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Legend ★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy mid-brown with very little head. Slight marmalade notes with a coffee dryness. Tastes of virtually nothing, just a very slight bitterness of chocolate.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Linda Lear ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown, with some bitterness in the aroma. A pretty average dark bitter, but there’s nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Munich Style Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, very little head, quite fizzy. Gooseberry/lemon aroma, quite dry. Very thin, some dryness, especially in the aftertaste. Tastes like other `real lagers’. Quite refreshing.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Northern Lights ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden in colour, with grapefruit citrus on the nose. Taste is similar and nicely clean. A dangerous beer considering the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Quill ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A Trappist-style dubbel, brewed to celebrate the brewery’s 3rd birthday and 200th brew. Ruby and cloudy with a large, but quickly vanishing head. Dark, roasted malts, with a little sourness. A bit odd, sort of a cross between a German dunkel and a dubbel, with a bit of gueuze. I quite liked it, others hated it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Summer into Autumn ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with some red hints. Small foamy white head. Smells quite sour, a little of which comes out in the taste. Also has some bitter hops. Similar to a Flanders red.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Turnstone</span></p>

  <br />Black and fizzy with small tan head. Smells like a stout. Slightly orangey, but that may be because I know what’s in it. Maybe some chocolate in the finish?</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  God’s Twisted Sister ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with tan head. Smells of roasted malt. Taste is similar. Some sweetness and a slight bitterness. Smooth and drinkable. Can’t really taste the licorice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  In Amber Clad ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />A rye IPA. Orange with white head. Resin and citrus notes. Very hoppy with resin and plenty of bitterness. Long, drying finish. A sipper, not a quaffer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Inspired ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small, tight white head. Smells of citrus with pine notes. Quite fizzy in the mouth. Not that much in the taste. Resin notes, some sweetness and bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Mmmm Munich Pale Ale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden, slightly hazy. Just off-white head. Huge amount of tropical fruit hops in the aroma. Resinous hops with fruit and a bitter finish. Very nice!</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sine Qua Non ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with white frothy head and a little yeast sediment. Flowery hops in the aroma. Quite fizzy with good bitter hops. Definitely an IPA.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  The Saison From Another Place ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark reddish brown with bubbly just off-white head. Smells slightly sour and spicy. Lots going on. Some orange citrus with a spicy and slightly flowery finish. Some light sweetness. Interesting and sippable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Two Towers</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Chamberlain Pale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden, very clear. Crisp taste with a nice, long, hoppy finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Mild and Brazen ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark red, smells quite sweet. Also a lot of sweetness in the taste. Quite rich.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Tynebank</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dark Brown Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark brown with white head. Quite thin and fruity. Pretty average.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Double IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden. Quite sweet and alcoholic, and not really enough hops to balance it. They’re certainly there, but not as dominant as you’d expect them to be.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Motueka Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with sticky white head. Some aroma of tropical fruit hops. Taste is similar with biscuit notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Tyskie ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a finger or so of white head. Smells of grain with some biscuity notes. Crisp and drinkable, but nothing exciting. Slightly dry finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Big Fat 5 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with white lacy head. Loads of hops in the aroma, especially tropical fruits (DIPA). Good balance of hops in the taste with fruitiness and a spicy, drying finish. Very nice!</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Urquell</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Pilsner Urquell ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />A good, solid, pilsner. Light, refreshing, slightly bitter, exactly what I was hoping it would be. Very clean and drinkable, especially when well chilled on a hot day.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Vakka-Suomen</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Prykmestar Suvi ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with birch leaves. Orange-golden with slightly sticky white head. Has a very interesting aroma with resin and some sour notes, which I’m going to assume is birch. Taste is distinctive, maybe resin, some spice and a bitter finish. Very interesting, and certainly not a standard lager.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Velvet Worm</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pale Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark golden with tight white head. Lots of malt and some sweetness in the aroma. Taste is much lighter with a clean, hoppy finish following a light sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Verdant</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Light Bulb ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden yellow with a white head. Quite a lot of carbonation. Smell has pineapple and grapefruit. Taste is light with sweet notes and a bitter/sour finish. Quite light-bodied but very drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Verulam</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Citra Hit ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy, golden orange in colour. Grapefruit, mango and other citrus in the aroma. Almost pithy, bitter taste with no real malt. Almost like a pale ale mixed with grapefruit juice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Verzet</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rebel Local ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with a tight, creamy white head. Smells slightly citrussy. Fizzy and crisp with some spice and soapiness. Apparently an IPA, but it’s not very hoppy and too fizzy to drink a lot of it.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Verzet Moose Blues ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very red with a small, pinkish head. Aroma has sourness and bisto meatiness. Quite tawny-port-like with sweetness and tannins with woody notes. Also raisins/dark fruit. Definitely weird, but not horrible.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Vibrant Forest</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Black October ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with tan head. Smells quite sweet with roasted and slight alcohol notes. Really rich and full-flavoured. Loads of roasted malt, very smooth but with a slight bitterness and alcohol twang in the finish. A seriously good stout.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Golden Monkey ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with large bubbles of carbonation. Smells of spice and yeast. Definitely a tripel. Well rounded but with definite alcohol in the finish. Could be Belgian, which is a big compliment!</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Storm King Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very black in colour with no head. Smells of alcohol, dark fruit and roasted, sweet malt. Quite full and dry, with a good hop burst in the mouth. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Vocation</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Life &amp; Death ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Straw coloured. Aroma of passion fruit, citrus, pineapple and malt. Taste is well balanced with tropical fruits and hop bitterness. My only real issue is that it’s a bit too fizzy.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">WEST</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  St Mungo ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small white head. Good balance of malt and hops, especially in the finish. Clean and crisp and drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  WEST Hefeweizen ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Looks exactly like a weissen should; hazy orange golden, although the head is smaller than you’d get from a bottle. Very fresh with good carbonation and some citrus to balance the banana and clove. A very nice biergarten beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wadworth</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Henry’s Original IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with a frothy, slightly tan head. Smells flowery. Quite fizzy in the mouth. Not really any hop flavour, quite flat and disappointing in general. This certainly isn’t an IPA; it’s missing the ABV and hops. All round, a bit dull and unexciting, but on ok bitter.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Horizon ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a white head and food lacing. Smells of bitter hops. Taste is a bit harsh, quite bitter, and not very balanced. Gets more drinkable towards the end of the pint though.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Horizon ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark amber with small, frothy off-white head that disappears quickly. Not a huge amount of aroma, some nuttiness and maybe some bready malt. Taste is bittersweet with some fruitiness and yeast notes. Dry finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  St George &amp; the Dragon ★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber colour. Some digestive malt along with orange citrus hops in the aroma. Blackcurrant and malt dominate the taste. A bit odd, with a metallic aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Swordfish ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />A blend of 6X and Pussers rum. Aroma has a nice mix of malt and rum. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy. Good depth of flavour with plentiful rum notes, dark fruit and a good bitterness in the finish. Nicely well-rounded and very drinkable, especially if you’re a rum fan.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  The Bishop’s Tipple ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with a creamy, white head. Smells of flowery hops and light malt. Clean, with a bittersweet and nicely hopped finish. Reminds me of a Badger beer, with definite flowery notes emerging in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Waen</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Blackberry Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pitch black with a tan head. Smells of burnt toast / soy sauce. Tastes dry and burnt with very little fruit. Lacking in aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Warwickshire Brewing Company</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Duck Soup ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a foamy white head. Smells of sweet malts. Rounded mouthfeel, with bready malts and a little bitterness. Possibly a good session beer, but nothing different or new.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Lady Godiva ★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with a creamy head. Smells of malt and maybe apples. Tastes grassy with a lack of hops. Easy to drink but gets very dull very quickly.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Shakespeare’s County ★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale straw, with a dense white head. Not a huge amount of aroma, perhaps slightly sweet. Some fruitiness, with malts and a dry finish. Distinctly average.</p>

  Keystone Hops ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with no head. Smells slightly sour, although the taste is clean and refreshingly hoppy. Has a lingering dry finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Miss Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black, with a small, slightly tan head which leaves lots of lacing. Some sweet, roasted malts in the aroma. Creamy mouthfeel, very smooth and easy to drink. Fills the mouth with roasted malts. Very nice session stout, not too heavy. And it was only 2 a pint!</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Victoria Works ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Frothy, slightly scummy white head. Some sweetness and a little bitterness, with some malt; very nicely rounded taste. A dry hop aftertaste finishes it off nicely.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Weihenstephaner Kristall ★★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Weihenstephaner Pilsner ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />From the oldest brewery in the world (in Munich), you’d be disappointed if they hadn’t worked out how to make a good beer by now. They don’t disappoint - very refreshing, slightly malty, with a bit of citrus and hops. Beautifully balanced.</p>

  Dark Hopfler ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Little Things That Kill ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with very fine white head. Lots of fruity hops in the aroma. Some resinous notes. Loads of hops in the taste. Actually well-balanced. Loads of flavour, especially given the ABV. A great low-alcohol IPA.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Weissbiebrauerei G. Schneider &amp; Sohn</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Meine Porter Weisse ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown with tight frothy white head. Malty aroma. Taste is indeed a mix of porter at the start followed by Weissbier. Very nice. Works surprisingly well.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Schneider Aventinus Eisbock ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Thick, syrupy and hazy brown. Very little head, some off white bubbles. Smells like a weissbier, with some banana and malt. Tastes like a weissbier, albeit a strong one. Yeast, with some wheat and alcohol and banana notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Schneider Mein Aventinus Barrique 2013 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Murky brown with a tight cream-coloured head. Sour fruits dominate the aroma - raspberry and cherry.  Fruity/berry and wine notes initially. Low carbonation. Some sourness. Very smooth despite the acidity. Perhaps some oak notes in the finish. Can also detect some of the underlying weissbier (banana, clove and yeast). Very complex; somewhat like Orval.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Schneider Weisse Tap 1 (Meine Blonde Weisse) ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />As the name suggests, it’s pretty light in colour for a weissbier. Hazy light golden with large white head. Clean aroma with yeast and spice. Very drinkable with banana and clove. Nice and light.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Schneider Weisse Tap 4 (Mein Grünes) ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />An organic (green) weissbier. Golden orange, with a standard weissbier haze and head. Some fruitiness in the aroma. Medium carbonation with quite a thick mouthfeel. Some spiciness, probably cloves and pepper. Malts give a sourdough bread flavour. Addition of yeast in the aftertaste, which is busy, but in an interesting way. Very drinkable, and manages to taste very pure.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Schneider Weisse Tap 5 (Meine Hopfenweisse) ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper coloured and hazy. Standard weissbier head. Smells of alcohol, with some hop bitterness and a little weissbier-banana. Quite highly carbonated. Some bitter hops and a creamy weissbierness with a little sweetness and then a nicely dry aftertaste. Some spice and banana with the addition of some lemony citrus later. This is very worryingly drinkable for the ABV. A great cross between a weissbier and an IPA.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Schneider Weisse Tap 6 (unser Aventinus) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very frothy (bottle conditioned). Cloudy, dark brown with a large, slightly tan head. Aroma is quite busy, with alcohol notes, malt and some rum. Some tingly carbonation. Taste has spices (clove) and slightly sweet alcohol undertone, balanced by roasted malt. More clove and alcohol in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Schneider Weisse Tap 7 (Original) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Quite dark for a weissbier, almost copper. Not a lot of aroma gets past the large head, perhaps some banana and spice. Not as powerful a taste as some other weisses, has a long sweet finish after the usual banana and spice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Schneider Weisse Tap X ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with streams of carbonation and a small, patchy white head. Alcohol in the nose with tropical fruits, a little banana and some grapefruit. Bready, yeasty weissbier with plenty of carbonation (perhaps too much). Some cloves and banana in the slightly sticky finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Welbeck Abbey</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Portland Black ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black colour. Mouthfeel is very different, somehow manages to be both chewy and thin at the same time. Very smooth and drinkable with some smoke and burnt toffee notes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wells and Youngs</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bombardier ★★★
  </span>
  <br />No real head, quite dark and reasonably fizzy, but not overly so. Well balanced combination of malts and hops, although it’s not really very exciting. Drinkable, but not a great beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bombardier Burning Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark orange with little head. Light hop aroma, with a similar taste, mostly dry and bitter, with a fizzy mouthfeel. Fresh and clean finish keeps it drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Bombardier Reserve ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with tight, creamy white head. Flowery and spicy hop aroma. Definite alcohol notes and plenty of hops. Pretty good.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Double Chocolate Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark black with a pretty sizeable tan head. Smells chocolatey with some roasted malt (so what you’d hope for). Tastes similar, but the chocolate seems a bit artificial, even though they use real chocolate. Nicely drinkable. Not overly sweet.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Eagle IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden amber, with a frothy white head. Smells of caramel and fruit. Taste is mostly malt, with a little bitterness in the finish. Not really an IPA, but would make a decent session bitter.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  London Gold ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a small white head. Smells a bit dirty, almost like a stale lager. Long-lasting fizz. Doesn’t do a lot and what it does isn’t really worth doing. No, thanks.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  McEwan’s Champion ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark chestnut with a couple of fingers of head. Smells sweet, with caramel and sweet malt. Also some alcohol notes. Similar flavour, with roasted malt and a bitterness in the finish. A bit sweet, but definitely drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wem</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Joybringer Ginger ★★
  </span>
  <br />Blonde. Smells and tastes almost entirely of ginger.</p>

  Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with small white head. Hoppy with a good bitterness and light malt in the finish. Some sweetness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Dub ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Unsurprisingly it’s black. No real head. Smells roasted, even slightly smokey. A bit thinner than I was expecting. Lots of roast flavour. Quite dry with smoke notes (although it’s not smoked). Long, dry finish. Nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kit Calvert’s Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with very little head. Smells malty and yeasty. Very drinkable with a good balance of malt and bitterness, just what you want from a bitter. Lingering hoppy finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wentworth Brewery</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Heartbeat ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark brown, frothy tan/white head, no fizz. Smells quite sweet with malt. Some fizz on the tongue. Very light taste, small amount of sweet roastedness followed by bitterness and astringency. Doesn’t taste as dark as it looks. More roasted malt as it warms up.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  In God We Trust ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper with a foamy white head. Strong aroma of hops, as there should be. Some fruitiness, but no real bitterness in the taste. Sweeter than I expected. More of an American style IPA.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Oyster Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark black, with a bubbly brown head. Smells of roasted malts and a little sweetness. Very tingly on the tongue. Some bitterness, coffee-like roast and something hard to place. It could be salt, or I could be imagining it, knowing that there’s real oysters in it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Summer Lovin’ ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale, plenty of hops lead to a nice dry beer. Quite refreshing, could do with some more malts to round it out.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Westgate</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sundance ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden, with a frothy head. Immediately seems like a session beer, with a little hop in the finish but nothing to really distinguish it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Whale Ales</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pale Whale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale with light, subtle hopping in both the taste and aroma. Very drinkable and liked by most.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Rio Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale copper. Both the aroma and taste are dominated by malt and sweetness. OK.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Ruby Moby ★★
  </span>
  <br />Ruby. Smells really weird and strong. Some roasted barley and hops, but the smell is somewhat overpowering.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">WharfeBank</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tether Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a slightly sour aroma. Tangy hops and fruit in the taste. OK, but a bit odd to be honest.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Whitefriars</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Olde Mild ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Ruby coloured with creamy, very slightly off-white head. Smells roasted and bitter with some sweet caramel. Dark and roasted taste with some dryness and extra roasted notes in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Whitstable</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kent Coast ★★★

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cat’s Whiskers ★★★

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Mirage ★★

  <br />Dark golden/copper. Smells green, with mustard and cress. Very slight spice which lingers. Some malt as well.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Special Pale Ale ★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden in colour. Smells quite dirty, taste is ok but not worth getting past the aroma.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wicked Hathern</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hathern Cross ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small head. Some zesty and malty hops in the aroma. Similar, slightly bittersweet taste. OK, but nothing special.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Widmer</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Steel Bridge Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with small, just off white head which is quite sticky. Smells and tastes of roast malt with a tingle on the tongue and a good, bitter finish. Very, very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Epic Saison ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden with a frothy white head. Musty sourness in the aroma, with some apple notes. Tingly and sour with a dryness in the finish. Quite one dimensional, but nosething wrong with it. Could certainly be more epic though!</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Fresh (2nd Edition) ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with some fizz in the pour, but no head. Smells quite grainy with some citrus/pineapple notes. Quite fizzy and lager-like but with definite pineapple in the finish. Quite interesting, but not amazing.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Murmur ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed with wine yeast. Copper with no head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Light taste with some bitterness, but not a huge amount going on. Drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Ninkasi ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy golden with a very large white head that dissipates quickly. Definite alcohol and some light apple notes in the aroma. Fizzy in the mouth. Some sourness and apple sweetness leading to a long, drying finish. Has some champagne-like qualities. Definite sipping beer; it’s pretty spritzy.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ninkasi Premier Cru ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Ninkasi aged in cider brandy barrels. Some sour notes, along with alcohol, Belgian yeast and cider. Definitely gueuzeish. Quite a lot of fizz in the mouth. Not obviously beery, or indeed that alcoholic. Quite sweet with no real bitterness, but some deep fruit alcohol in the finish. A little bit odd.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Yankee Sandwich ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Nearly black with no head. Smells rich with a hint of peanuts. Definite rich stout with a peanut finish. Odd but nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Zintuki ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Cloudy golden with a small white head. Aroma of lemon and other sour fruit (berries?). Taste is expectedly sour with more lemon and some yeast, with a slightly tart finish. Went very well with a curry.</p>

  Shrimps and Barbies ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy orange with tight white head. Grapefruit citrus aroma. Dominated by resin hops. Not too fizzy. Slightly astringent aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Williams Bros</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Alba Scots Pine Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly cloudy, dark brown with no head. Smells of pine (shock) and malts. Slightly sweet with definite pine notes although not to the overkill level. Reasonably drinkable, but probably better as a once off.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Birds and Bees ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale golden with small bubbly white head, with a little lacing. Smells of citrus hops. Some fizz. Smells quite alcoholic. Initial taste is a bit chemically, a bit bland and then lots of hops which linger in the finish. Slightly more rounded when warmed up, but the finish is very weird. Contains elderflower.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Caesar Augustus ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with a large, rocky white head. Smells hoppy with definite citrus notes. Lovely dry hop taste with grapefruit. Crisp and clean, much more like an IPA than a lager. Very nice.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ceildh Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden and pale. Some hops and citrus in the aroma. A little bland but a pretty good refreshing lager.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Chokka Blokka ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a coffee/chocolate stout - shock. Dark brown with a beige head, but equally good straight out of the can. Roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate in the aroma. Taste is very similar. It’s pretty intense and very, very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cock o’ the Walk ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Medium brown with a tight white head. Light aroma with some sweet malt and very light hopping. Caramel in the taste, with quite a lot of hops and bitterness. Quite dry and a bit boring. Very average.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Double Joker IPA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with tight, creamy white head. Loads of hops in the aroma, almost to the point of smelling dirty. Also some alcohol. Definitely strong. Hops, but they’re very deep and not anywhere near as refreshing as the normal version. OK, but a bit one dimensional and dominated by the alcohol.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ebulum ★★★
  </span>
  <br />An elderberry black ale. Dark brown, with lots of small, tan bubbles which last quite a while. Some tart fruit in the aroma, along with some sweetness. Moderate carbonation. Full bodied and easy to drink. Sweet, and roasted malt with a mild berry flavour, which is stronger in the finish. Tart, almost burnt flavour in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Fraoch ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden in colour with a thin white foam. Smells floral, with some honey/nectar notes. Some sweetness at the start that leads to a dry, almost herbal flavour with a warming aftertaste. Very drinkable, and certainly something different. Well worth trying.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Fraoch 22 ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light copper with a small white head. Some whisky in the aroma, along with light heather undertones. Whisky again in the flavour with a bit of sweetness. Well-rounded and certainly doesn’t taste like the ABV.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Good Times ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with small white head. Smells citrusy. Tingle in the mouth. Very zesty and refreshing. Worryingly drinkable. Good summer session beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Grozet ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Lagered fruit beer. Mostly clear, a little cloudiness from the pectin, with no head. Smells of fruit (gooseberries) and grain. Fizzy mouthfeel. Slightly tea-like taste with gooseberry dryness. A good, refreshing summer beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Harvest Sun ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with a large, frothy head. Smells hoppy with both bitter and citrus aromas. Quite fizzy, but has a crisp mouthfeel and a dry hop finish. NIce and clean with good citrus flavours.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Hipsway ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with bubbly white head. Lots of hops in the aroma, mostly fruity. Initially light and maybe even a bit thin but an excellent hippy finish with both fruit and a lingering bitterness. Nice.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Joker IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with a froth of just-off-white head that leaves good lacing. Plenty of citrus hops in the aroma along with some light grain notes. Clean tasting with some drying hops, especially in the finish. A very drinkable IPA with enough tingle in the mouth and hop flavour to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kelpie Seaweed Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pours very fizzy, with a quickly vanishing light tan head. Very dark amber, almost black colour. Smells like a bitter porter with roasted malts. Some carbonation in the mouth. The taste is mostly roasted malts which lead to chocolate. Don’t really pick up any seaweed, although it could add to the bitter smell. Quite earthy, with a slightly thin feel.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  March of the Penguins ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Jet black with a light tan head. Smells bitter. Fizzy mouthfeel. Taste has some chocolate malt and a good hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Midnight Sun ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black. Smells of dark fruit, which follows through into the taste. Also a little alcohol kick, some liquorice and aniseed. Smooth and pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Paradigm Shift ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown with no head. Malt, sweetness, hops and fruit in the aroma. Rich with hop bitterness and a lingering, drying finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Prodigal Sun ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper with a very small white head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Taste has fruit, spice, some sweetness like honey or mead. A bittersweet finish with lingering, flowery notes. Nice and unique, the only criticism is that it’s a bit sweet.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Profanity Stout ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark, if not entirely black. Smells quite light and sweet with some roast bitterness. Tastes lightly roasted, with coffee notes. Some fruit, and generally quite clean. Mouthfeel is well-balanced. Lacks some kick or excitement.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Redact ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A red lager. Copper with very little head. Smells of citrus hops with some sweetness and bitterness. Clean with an interesting mix of grapefruit and sweetness with a little malt.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Seven Giraffes ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden yellow, with no fizz or lacing. Smells of hops, with some light malt and citrus. Quite complex - citrus hops, with malt and a slightly spicy dryness in the finish. Nicely drinkable, but doesn’t really stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Stravaigin ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with very little head. Smells of gooseberries and herbs. Definitely herbs, very distinctive. Bog myrtle? Interesting and drinkable. Can taste the ABV.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Talking Head ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy golden with frothy white head with some lacing. Pine aroma with some light tropical fruit. Taste is similar with a slightly odd, bitter finish. It’s fine but not exciting at all.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Tin Man ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Tropical IPA. Slightly hazy golden with a bubbly white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is sweet with some fruitiness. Taste is complex, or maybe a bit all over the place. Tropical fruits lead to quite a lot of bitterness in the finish. Also some resin notes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Williams Red ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly red in colour. Biscuity malt aroma with not a lot of hops. Taste is a bit thin and dull, but there’s really nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wilson Potter</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  In Shreds ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with very tight, creamy white head. Smells slightly zesty. Very clean with a lovely hippy, citrus finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Windsor Castle</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sadler’s Thin Ice ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale with some hop aroma but not a lot going on. Some sharp citrus/hops in the middle with a lingering citrus bitterness. Refreshing and drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Windswept</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  APA ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear golden with white head. Subtle aroma - maybe some malt and citrus. Slightly sweet with grassy and some floral hops.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Aurora ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with both the aroma and taste dominates by citrus. Well hopped with a slight bitterness in the finish. A decent enough pale ale.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wintercoat</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Oatmeal Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a foamy tan head that quickly dissipates. Smells roasted with a little sweetness and a hint of burnt toast. Very fizzy mouthfeel and quite thin. Lots of bitter, roasted malt and a drying, bitter, tingly finish. Nice, but lacking in body.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Vildmoseøl ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of peaty smoke, with some spicy herb notes (which apparently is bog myrtle) and a sweetness, which could come from the rowan berries. Copper coloured, very fizzy pour with frothy white head that becomes rocky. Slight tingle in the mouth. Quite sour, but balanced by fruit initially. Finish is sour and smokey, which is nicer than it sounds. Warming aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wiper and True</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Milkshake ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Milk stout. Very, very dark with small white head. Roasted aroma with some sweetness. Quite sweet and creamy with some roasted malt and then a chocolate-sweet finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wired</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Flat White ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with off-white head. Smells quite sweet. Tingly in the mouth with definite coffee notes leading to a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wizard</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Sorcerer ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper bitter with a lacy head. Aroma has a malty sweetness and a little hop. Well balanced with a little spice and some caramel. Drinkable but in no way outstanding.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wojak</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Jasny Pelny ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very clear, light golden with a small white head. Little carbonation. Smells of light fruits, a bit perfumey. A little bland, maybe some peach. No bitterness, a little sweetness, and a very thin mouthfeel. Drinkable but a little uninspiring.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wold Top</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dawn O’Time ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orangey with a tight, white head. Some citrus and grass in the smell, followed by fizz in the mouthfeel. Nice and clean with a dry bitterness and some fruit notes.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wood</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hopping Mad ★★★
  </span>
  <br />A golden bitter. Quite like a light mild. Good session beer with some dryness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wood Farm</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  1823 Mild ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark with lots of aroma - some sweet fruitiness and roasted malt. All the flavour comes from the smell. Very slight bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Best Bitter ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Exactly what a session beer should be.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  No 8 ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber coloured. Smells of fruit and caramel. Taste is quite sweet, but the malty finish cuts through it quite nicely.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Pride ★★
  </span>
  <br />Mid brown. Smells and tastes of dirty veg, although there is some hopping in the finish, which just about saves it from being undrinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Union ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden, with a foamy white head. Smells strong with definite American hops. Very clean, but surprisingly litle hops in the aftertaste. Nice, lingering finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Victorious ★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark copper with a foamy white head. Quite sweet and malty with a small amount of hops. Quite dull.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wood’s</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Shropshire Lad ★★★
  </span>
  <br />It’s a generic, bittersweet strongish bitter. Drinkable but unexciting.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wooden Hand</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Black Pearl ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with a tan head. Smells sweet with a little roasted malt. Slightly tingly, and surprisingly a little thin in the mouth. Some hops, especially in the finish. Also has some light coffee notes.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cornish Gribben ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a few bubbles and a patchy white head. Smells fruity. Tastes of citrus, tropical fruits and grassy malt. Also has a lingering sweetness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Cornish Mutiny ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper, smells a bit smokey with bitter hops. Taste is similar, with some biscuity malt. Not bad, but not inspiring.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pirates Gold ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper, with a creamy white head. Smells malty with a little sweetness. Very smooth with no fizz. Malt and a little bitterness in the finish. Dull but drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Woodlands</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Woodlands Mild ★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wooha</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  IPA ★★★★
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Wooha Porter ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Black with a medium, tan head. Aroma has chocolate and roasted malt, perhaps also some coffee. Taste is very similar. Nicely drinkable, with a smooth finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Worthington’s</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  White Shield ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smells of tropical fruits, coriander and citrus. Very pale, with a surprising amount of bubbles. Light and refreshing, with a bitter, hoppy finish that lingers on the tongue. Very refreshing, but perhaps a little too bland. Very good session beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Wychwood</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  Black Wych ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with tan head. Smells rich and malty. Very smooth and drinkable with a little tingle of carbonation. Rounded, roasted malt with a nice bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

  </span>
  <br />Clear golden colour with sparkly head. Smells hoppy with some biscuit malt and grain. Taste has a good hop bitterness with some piney resin notes, leading to a sweet finish. Quite a lot of carbonation. Very drinkable but not exceptional.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Dr Thirsty’s No 4 Blonde ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Perfect if you’re thirsty. Pale, very little going on, light and drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Dryneck ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Zesty hop aroma with orange notes. Powerful hit of fruity hops - bitter orange and some berry. Not too fizzy. An interesting and thirst quenching beer. Nice use of mosaic hops.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Duchy Originals Organic Golden Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Light golden with lots of carbonation and a thick white head. Smells grassy with some hops and sweetness. Taste is balanced with a good mix of light malts and hops with some citrus bitterness in the finish. However, it is overly fizzy.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Fiddler’s Elbow ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber coloured with a creamy white head which leaves good lacing. Smell has mild citrus notes and some yeast. Smooth and crisp with plenty of malt and floral hops. Almost buttery at times. A very nice pint.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Fire Catcher ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with gooseberry aroma. Loads of gooseberry flavour too. Clean, crisp and very drinkable with a lingering fruit bitterness.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Goliath ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Disappointingly no longer comes in 660ml bottles. More ruby than pale, moderate carbonation with a creamy white head. Lots of malt, with a somewhat bitter, hoppy aftertaste. Drinkable, but the lack of bitterness in the aftertaste is offputting.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Hobgoblin ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Ruby with a light smattering of tan head. Smells of chocolate/coffee with some sweetness. Very smooth with just a tingle of carbonation. Malt sweetness dominates but is well balanced in the end by hop bitterness. Very well rounded, and something of a benchmark beer.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hobgoblin ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Like a toned-down version of the bottle version.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Hobgoblin Gold ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with large creamy white head. Loads of citrus and floral hops in the aroma. Nicely balanced mix of hops. Clean, slightly zingy and very drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Hobgoblin IPA ★★★
  </span>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  King Goblin ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear copper with a frothy, very slightly tan head. Smells of spice and caramel sweetness, perhaps with dark fruit undertones. Tastes of sweet malt with dark fruit and a little spice, so very similar to the nose. Also some alcohol notes, along with a tingle in the mouth. Rather like an aged hobgoblin, and definitely a sipping beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Pumpking ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Golden with a frothy white head. Smells of nutmeg/mace. Has a warming spice taste with a hint of sweetness and bitter hops in the finish. No pumpkin flavour comes through. Nice deep flavour, which makes a very drinkable beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Scarecrow ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale in colour, with a strong hop aroma, also some light malt. Quite dry, which continues into the finish. Taste is mostly hops with some barley. Uncomplicated, but what it does, it does very well.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Snake’s Bite ★★
  </span>
  <br />Very pale, looks like a cider, smells like a cider with definite apple aromas. Quite sweet with an odd, fake apple taste and a sticky finish. A bit weird.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  White Wych ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden in colour, pours with a lasting white head. Not much carbonation. Sweet nose, with some vanilla and citrus. Dry and citrus-hop bitter with a brief, refreshing aftertaste. Ok, but let down by the lack of aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Wychcraft ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Amber with some orange hues. Small white head. Quite fizzy in the glass with a moderate sweet malt aroma. Slight caramel taste quickly followed by a hoppy finish. A very refreshing summer beer.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Ark Ale ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden/amber, slightly cloudy. Some white head with a little sparse lacing. Slight citrus/gooseberry/apricot in the aroma, along with a little dryness. Smooth and creamy, a little tartness on the sides of the tongue and some grassiness. Dry, chalky finish.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Butty Bach ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orange in colour with a small white head. Mile malt aroma with a little caramel and some hops. Nice crisp, clean malt taste with a little grassy hops. Very drinkable session beer.</p>

  Gander ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Actually a gooseberry sour IPA. Clear golden with rapidly-vanishing white head that leaves a sticky lacing. Sour aroma, but not overpowering. Definite fruit notes. Quite fizzy with a gooseberry tang, which lingers into the finish.</p>

  <br />Clear golden with very little head. Not a huge amount of aroma or taste, but drinkable.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Garsdale Smokebox ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Smoked porter made with Bamberg smoked malt. Black with no head. Aroma is dominated by smoke. Taste is a mixture of smoke and bitterness. Very interesting and definitely competitive with German smoked beers.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Muker Silver ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear light golden with fine streams of carbonation. Smells light and quite sharp. Taste is similar. Not quite as clean as a German helles.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Yuengling Brewery</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Yuengling Traditional Lager ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear amber with some off-white head and a bit of lacing. Smells of light malt, with some sweetness and maybe a touch of hops. Taste is also malty with more hops than in the aroma. Quite good body. Not bad at all.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Zateck Pivovar</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Zatec 12° ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Aroma of floral hops, with a taste to match, complete with the addition of some citrus overtones. Very drinkable and refreshing. It’s what you’d expect from a pils, but with the hops notched up.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Zum Uerige</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Uerige Altbier ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Hazy copper colour with a finger of thick white head. Aroma is hops with some sweet malt and possibly some fruit. Taste is malty with a cleansing hop bitterness. Nicely drinkable.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">Zywiec Breweries</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Jasny Pelny ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with a white bubbly head and quickly-vanishing lacing. Not a huge amount of aroma. Nicely rounded with some bitter hops followed by mat and then a warming lingering finish with a little dry hop.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating2">
  Tatra Mocne ★★
  </span>
  <br />Clear copper, with good lacing and a thin white head. SMells lagery, with grass and a little spice. Tastes quite Belgian, with some sweetness and grain. Not brilliant.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Woodford’s Wherry ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Bottle, but only for the journey between Banbury and Coventry. Copper with a little carbonation. Smells sweet with some hopping. Good mouthfeel and quite a well-balanced combination of malt and hops. Perhaps a little too sweet and green, but Alan reckoned it could do with another week or two anyway.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">[Homebrew] Chris</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  Kitchen Bob ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Slightly hazy copper with a small white head. Alcohol notes in the nose with fizz in the mouth and a good balance of malt and hops.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">[Homebrew] Kate</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Barn Owl Brew ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Copper-red, smells quite sweet (molasses/golden syrup). Some malt and a little spice from the hops. Very nice; good work Kate.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Gronings Blackup ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a tan head. Smells sweet with dark malt. Tastes similar, but nicely rounded.</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">[Homebrew] Lauren</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Imperial Stout ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with a brown head that explodes out the bottle. Good, rich and malty aroma with plenty of roast notes. Taste is excellent, again with dark malt and some dark fruitiness. Just a shame most if it ended up over the kitchen!</p>

<p><span class="beers_brewery">[Homebrew] Me</span></p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Belgian Pale ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark golden with very little head and a bit of carbonation. Smells slightly sweet with some banana and spice notes. Similar in taste with a nice fruity finish. Happy with this one.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating3">
  German Weiss ★★★
  </span>
  <br />Dark straw coloured. Bottle conditioned so pours clear or cloudy depending on preference. Doesn’t have the traditional weissbier head though. Aroma has light hints of banana and spices (clove). Taste is smooth with a light spiced aftertaste.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating5">
  London Porter ★★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Very dark with fine bubbles of tan head. Roasted malts and slight bitterness in the aroma. Taste is very interesting with roasted, almost burnt notes and a very long hop bitterness in the finish. Smooth and drinkable, with enough of a kick at the end to keep it interesting. Very happy with how this one turned out.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  New Zealand Pilsner ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Pale golden with quite a lot of carbonation. Frothy white head. Lots of bitter and dry fruit hops in the aroma. Clean, fruity and bitter. Does a lot more than you’d expect from a pils. Much more like an IPA. Very nice, even if I do say so myself…</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Punk IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Brewed from a kit. It’s actually pretty similar to the original, with a nice balance of hops. Could maybe do with some more fizz, but is clean, hoppy (tropical fruit) and drinkable. Pretty happy with how it came out.</p>

<p>bottle</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">
  Razorback IPA ★★★★
  </span>
  <br />Orangey-golden with very little head. Fine streams of carbonation. Big whack of bitter hops in the aroma. Clean, with a little tingle of fizz. Loads of bitterness leads to a slightly drying finish. Pretty balanced and a bit reminiscent of a dry cider in terms of mouth feel. Certainly wouldn’t know it’s homebrew!</p>
