<p>I believe that communicating the excitement and beauty of mathematics to a wide audience is an important aspect of my work as researcher. This page highlights some of the things that I (along with many talented and enthusiastic collaborators) do in these areas.</p>

<p><strong>Current opportunity:</strong>  Along with Francesca Iezzi and Zoe Wyatt, I have a small University of Edinburgh Principalâ€™s Teaching Award Scheme grant for <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-academic-development/learning-teaching/funding/funding/previous-projects/year/march-2019/widening-participation-maths-circles">Widening participation in Maths Circles</a>.  In particular, this includes money to help people run Maths Circles in their schools or local communities.  Please get in touch if youâ€™re interested in this!</p>

      <p>The Edinburgh Maths Circle is a free drop-in session where children aged 5 to 16 and their families can join in with exciting mathematical activities, games and puzzles. Students and members of staff from the School of Mathematics are on hand to help out, and refreshments are provided. We are also running a scheme in which our resources can be lent out to local schools and community groups.</p>

      <p>Maths Inspiration is one of the most successful Maths enrichment programs in the UK. During this fun and interactive show, some of the best Maths communicators inspire our teenagers, by showing them the beauty and applicability of Mathematics.  We run the first, and only, such event in Scotland.</p>

      <p>We have organised a number of collaborative, maths-inspired art projects. The two largest have been the <a href="http://www.megamenger.com/">MegaMenger</a> (a giant distributed fractal made from business cards) and <a href="http://www.manchestermegapixel.com/">MegaPixel</a> (a back-lit picture made by colouring individual pixels).</p>

      <p>MathsJam is a monthly opportunity for like-minded self-confessed maths enthusiasts to get together in a pub and share stuff they like. Puzzles, games, problems, or just anything they think is cool or interesting. We meet on the second-to-last Tuesday of every month, from around 7pm in the evening, in locations around the world.  I organise the Edinburgh event.</p>
