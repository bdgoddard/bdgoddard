      <p>The Edinburgh Maths Circle is a free drop-in session where children aged 5 to 16 and their families can join in with exciting mathematical activities, games and puzzles. Students and members of staff from the School of Mathematics are on hand to help out, and refreshments are provided. We are also running a scheme in which our resources can be lent out to local schools and community groups.</p>
      <p><em>Jointly organised with Francesca Iezzi and Zoe Wyatt</em></p>
