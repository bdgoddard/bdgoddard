<p>I am currently a supervisor for the <a href="https://www.mac-migs.ac.uk/">MAC-MIGS</a> CDT (Maxwell Institute Graduate School Centre for Doctoral Training in Modelling, Analysis, and Computation).  PhDs in MAC-MIGS are four years, with the first year devoted primarily to training (i.e. further study), group work, and an extended project (which normally leads into a PhD).  Note that MAC-MIGS students do not choose their supervisor on arrival, but rather have a chance to meet potential supervisors and make an informed decision about which projects they are interested in.</p>

<p>I have a wide range of possible projects to offer.  See <a href="http://localhost:4000/research">my research page</a>, and feel free to <a href="mailto:b.goddard@ed.ac.uk">email me</a> if you have any questions, or would like more detail about possible projects.  If you are interested in my research areas, then you should consider applying to MAC-MIGS.</p>

  Rory is working on the dynamics of suspensions of hard particles, in particular the inclusion of short-range hydrodynamic interactions (lubrication forces) in both particle-based methods and statistical mechanics. Rory is also interested in the rigorous analysis of DDFT-like equations.  He completed his viva in January 2020.

  Mildred did her first year extended project on PDE-constrained optimization, in particular focusing on the inclusion of non-local terms, which are vital for many particle-based models, such as in complex fluids, opinion formation, or drone control. She is now extending this work through a combination of rigorous analysis and numerics.

    <h4>Miguel A. Duran-Olivencia</h4>
    <p><i>Postdoc, 2015-2017</i></p>
    <p>Miguel was a postdoc joint with <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/complexmultiphasesystems">Serafim Kalliadasis</a> and <a href="http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~pavl/">Greg Pavliotis</a> (Imperial College London), working on our EPSRC funded grant â€˜Statistical mechanics of soft matter: Derivation, analysis and implementation of dynamic density functional theoriesâ€™.  He was primarily working on dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) for anisotropic particles.  In particular, he was focussing on the inclusion of inertia and hydrodynamic interactions in such models, which are crucial for describing a range of physical processes such as nucleation.  He is now working in the finance industry, primarily using stochastic models.</p>
