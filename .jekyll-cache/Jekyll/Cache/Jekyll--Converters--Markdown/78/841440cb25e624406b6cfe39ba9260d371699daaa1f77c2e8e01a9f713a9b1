<p>### 1 Dampfbierbrauerei Zwiesel</p>

<p>Arbier Special Pale golden with a fine, but frothy white head. Grassy aroma and taste with a little spice. Quite clean with a slight tang in the finis. OK, if a little dull.</p>

<p>Dampfbier Chestnut with a large, rapidly-vanishing head. Smells of slightly burnt malt. Quite thin with not a lot going on, but it is very quaffable.</p>

<p>Pfeffer Hell Slightly hazy golden with a small, tight white head. Smells grainy with lemon notes. Taste is similar and seems more like a Belgian wit than a Helles. However, that doesn‚Äôt stop it from being very nice.</p>

<p>Zwickl Slightly explodey from a flip top bottle. Hazy golden with a large, vanishing off-white head. Looks a lot like a weissbier. Slightly sweet nose with some malt, a bit like a strong-smelling helles. Clean, smooth and mellow, with a bit of sharpness in the finish. Nicely drinkable.</p>

<p>### 4 Pines</p>

<p>4 Pines Hefeweizen Pale golden with frothy white head. Smells yeasty. Quite fizzy with light yeast and spice. More like a Belgian ale than a hefeweizen.</p>

<p>### 71 Brewing</p>

<p>Passion Killer Clear orange with very little head. Aroma is mostly sour. Quite a tingly mouthfeel. Initial sour notes lead into a passionfruit finish. Clean and very drinkable, with a tingly, fruity finish.</p>

<p>### 8 Sail Brewery</p>

<p>Oat Malt Stout Black with no head. Smells bitter and roasted. Quite a lot of fizz. Roast and sourness. Less creamy than I was expecting from an oat stout. OK.</p>

<p>Old Colony Dark copper with no head. Aroma of fruity, resinous hops. Lots of bitterness, some touches of fruit and resin in the finish. Dry, lingering aftertaste. Pretty clean and standard.</p>

<p>### ABC</p>

<p>Aston Distressway Dark brown ale. Bit of a weird smell. Perfectly drinkable though. Mainly malts with a little bitterness and a dry finish.</p>

<p>Rotunda Red Dark ruby. A malty sweetness in the aroma. Very flat and watery, some sweetness. Tastes very green.</p>

<p>Sporting Gold Pale golden with a faint hop aroma. Tastes very flat and generally a little boring.</p>

<p>### Abbaye de Leffe</p>

<p>Leffe 9 Golden orange with small white head. Slight sweetness, some spice and yeast in the aroma. MAybe some light alcohol notes too. Taste has yeast, warming spice and some alcohol with a slight sharpness and burn in the finish. Quite full and chewy with a slight tingle of fizz.</p>

<p>Leffe Bi√®re de Printemps Copper with a froth of off-white head. Smells of fruit with caramel sweetness, yeast, bread and a little smoke. Sweet malt and alcohol notes with a dry, bitter finish. Not a huge amount going on and lacking the richness of normal Leffe.</p>

<p>Leffe Blonde Deep golden colour. Smells slightly of fruit, reminiscent of a weissbier. Smooth and strong tasting, creamy yet with a slight tingle. Some sweetness in the aftertaste but balanced by bitterness. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Leffe Blonde 0.0% Clear golden with a white head - looks like Leffe. That‚Äôs pretty much where the similarity ends. Dominated by sweetness and malt with some bitterness and maybe clove. Typically of low-alcohol beers like this it tastes underdone and lacks body.</p>

<p>Leffe Brune Brown with some ruby notes. Some lacing. Some spicing with some confectioners sugar. Nicely full mouthfeel. Finishes bittersweet.</p>

<p>Leffe De No√´l Dark golden with a small white head. Spice and malt in the nose. Very nice, with a good mix of spices and malt and a nice, smokey finish.</p>

<p>Leffe Radieuse Dark amber with a tan head. Aroma is dominated by red fruit and some hop bitterness. The taste is similar with some alcohol notes. A bit meh.</p>

<p>Leffe Royale Clear golden with a creamy white head. Sweet malt, Belgian yeast, alcohol and more hopping than a standard Leffe, both in the aroma and the taste. A very nice sipping beer that develops a very slight smokiness.</p>

<p>Leffe Ruby Red with plenty of carbonation and a foamy head. Smells sweet with some fake cherry. Taste is similar; far too sweet and weird.</p>

<p>Leffe Tripel Hazy golden with a white frothy head. Smells of yeast, a bit of sweetness and coriander. Quite fizzy. Taste is dominated by alcohol, but there‚Äôs some bitterness in the finish. Not as nice as either of the two `standard‚Äô Leffes.</p>

<p>### Abbeydale</p>

<p>Demon Drink Pale golden, with a slight hoppy bitterness. Very refreshing and also very drinkable. Slightly creamy malt finish.</p>

<p>Moonshine Pale golden, straw colours. Smells flowery with peachy notes. Good clean taste with a little floweriness and some bitter hops in the finish.</p>

<p>White Christmas Very light straw colour with good lacing. Some haziness, smells of citrus, perhaps orange. Complex and flowery. Refreshing, with some citrus tang in the aftertaste. Perhaps a bit too sweet, somewhat dominated by candy sugar which overpowers the hops.</p>

<p>### Abbot</p>

<p>Heritage Mild Ale Jet black with bubbly tan head. Smells roasted and slightly sour. Full bodied, roasted, some bitterness in the finish. Very smooth and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Abro Bryggeri</p>

<p>Bron India Pale Ale Hazy amber with thick white head. Aroma of sweet malt and maybe some floral notes. Not a huge amount going on in the taste, especially since it‚Äôs supposed to be an IPA. Decent beer though.</p>

<p>### Acorn Brewery</p>

<p>Barnsley Bitter Dark copper, with a slightly off-white head. Some roasted coffee notes with a bit of burnt caramel. Other than that, it‚Äôs a pretty standard, but drinkable, bitter.</p>

<p>Gorlovka Imperial Stout Aroma is roast malts, with some liquorice. Surprisingly thin bodied for an imperial stout, some roast malt and dark fruit. In contrast, the finish is full of roasted malt.</p>

<p>### Adnams</p>

<p>Adnams Bitter Copper coloured with a small head that leaves a lot of lacing. Smells caramelly, possibly with some soft fruits (peach/plum). Sweetish tastes with some malts, not overly bitter.</p>

<p>Adnams Broadside Red-copper coloured with a tight head. Smells of roasted malts with some fruit and floral hops. Taste is similar, perhaps a little too sweet. Very creamy mouthfeel.</p>

<p>Adnams Explorer Designed to be served cold. Aroma is malt with citrus hops. Golden amber in colour. Some bready malt with plenty of hops in the taste.</p>

<p>Adnams Gunhill Dark red with a tight head. Some fruit and roasted malt in the aroma and taste, which also has some hop dryness. Malts and a nice crispness in the finish. Nicely drinkable; a good session beer.</p>

<p>Adnams Lighthouse Bright chestnut brown with a slightly tan head. Some lacing. Not a huge amount of aroma, some grain and a little malt. Taste is malt with a little hop aftertaste. Quite refreshing.</p>

<p>Adnams Southwold Bitter Copper with a creamy, very slightly off-white head. Smells of sweet malt with hop bitterness. Very smooth mouthfeel. Good balance of initial sweetness and a bitter aftertaste. Quite basic, but a decent bitter.</p>

<p>Adnams Spiced Winter Beer Dark copper with frothy white head. Smells quite a lot like pot pouri with orange, cinnamon and possibly chocolate. Tastes similar, with some additional bitterness. Clove and cinnamon come through strongest. Not bad, but a bit busy.</p>

<p>Adnams Winter IPA (aka Innovation) Amber with very little head. Smells of tropical fruit with hops and some grapefruit/citrus bitterness. Well balanced with some sweetness, nice hop bitterness, biscuity malt and a little alcohol warmth in the finish.</p>

<p>Ghost Ship Dark golden with a small white head. Some citrus hops in the aroma which follow into the taste. Drinkable session beer, but I‚Äôve definitely had better Adnam‚Äôs beers.</p>

<p>Ghost Ship Alcohol Free Clear golden with a thick white head. Has a slightly grassy aroma, but also citrus hops and some malt. Taste is slightly sweet with good hop bitterness and citrus notes. Very nice, especially on a hot day in a field.</p>

<p>Solebay Slightly cloudy orange-yellow. Aroma is alcohol notes with some sweetness and Christmas spices. Taste is remarkably similar to the smell.</p>

<p>Spindrift Clear golden with small white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Grainy with some sweetness, a little bitterness and not a lot else.</p>

<p>Halcyon Sterling Very pale and hoppy (uses only one American hop) and fizzier than would be expected for an ale. Clean hop taste with a nice bitter finish. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Silly Saaz Very pale with a frothy, quickly-vanishing head. Smells of green hops and has a lingering dry finish.</p>

<p>### Alechemy</p>

<p>Bad Day at the Office Golden with creamy white head. Smells slightly dirty with some vegetable notes. Actually pretty Clean tasting with some fruity hops. A bit of fizz in the mouth.</p>

<p>Cairnpapple IPA Pale golden and bubbly. Good aroma of floral hops. Surprisingly malty, with a strong bitter hop aftertaste. Interesting enough but nothing really new.</p>

<p>Charisma Hazy golden with small white head. Some fruity hops in the aroma and taste. It‚Äôs not overly exciting, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>Citra Burst Light golden with a white head, which quickly fades. Aroma and taste are both as you‚Äôd expect - plenty of citra hops and some acidity. Quite a juicy finish.</p>

<p>Damona Milk stout. Jet black with a just-off-white head. Quite sweet smelling. Taste is similarly sweet with a little spice, especially in the finish.</p>

<p>Ekuarillo Pale golden with tight white head. A slightly strange mix of sweetness, biscuit malt and dry American-style hops. Pretty good, but I‚Äôm not sure it knows what it‚Äôs trying to be. A bit sweet for me, too.</p>

<p>Galaxy Burst Pale golden with bubbly white head. Lots of fruit hops in the aroma. Big hit of resinous hops with a lingering, bitter finish. Very drinkable. Definitely a good single hop beer.</p>

<p>Mosaic Burst Copper with small white head. Good hop aroma.  Resinous with a spicy almost mint finish.</p>

<p>Photon IPA Light brown with tight, creamy white head. Big aroma of tropical fruit. Orange and resin dominate the taste with a clean bitterness in the finish. Nice.</p>

<p>Ritual Pale golden with a white head that leaves sticky lacing. Some malt and light hops in the aroma. Taste is much stronger with an initial maltiness leading to a good hit of bitter citrus and spicy hops that lingers in the finish. A nice, refreshing IPA.</p>

<p>Shoulders of Giants Clear golden with small, creamy white head. Described as a session IPA. More of just a pale ale. Dominated by light malt and hop bitterness. Lingering, bitter finish.</p>

<p>Slippery When Wheat A white IPA. Orange with no head. Some grapefruit/citrus aroma. Pretty sharp-tasting with more citrus and quite a lot of fizz. Some spicy notes and lemon in the finish.</p>

<p>Ascent Golden amber with a good head. Aroma of biscuit malt. Taste has some malt notes and also some orange citrus. Nothing wrong with it at all.</p>

<p>Curlews Return Reddish brown with tight just off-white head. Good hop aroma. Lots of American style hops in the flavour. Very drinkable and interesting.</p>

<p>GFPA Orange-golden with small white head. Smells quite bitter with some fruit aromas. Very clean-tasting with hop bitterness and some dry notes in the finish. A very respectable, bitter pale ale. Not obviously gluten free in any way.</p>

<p>Pennine Pale Pale golden with white head. Lots of fruity hops in the aroma. Taste is similar. Much like a slightly less fizzy version of Punk IPA. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Alpha State</p>

<p>Cream Ale Slightly hazy golden with tight white head. Lots of hop aroma with soft fruits and some resin notes. Follows through into the taste. Clean and not too bitter and pretty interesting. Like a fruity IPA that‚Äôs very smooth to drink.</p>

<p>### Amarcord Birra Arigianale Italiana</p>

<p>AMA Bionda Slightly hazy golden with a tight white head. Some alcohol and yeast notes in the aroma. Very fizzy in the mouth. Quite clean with some spice, but also a strange soapiness in the finish. Doesn‚Äôt stop it being quite drinkable though.</p>

<p>### Ampelforth Abbey</p>

<p>Ampleforth Dubbel Clear brown with small bubbles of white head around the side of the glass. Tastes as you‚Äôd expect from a dubbel; clean with a bit of spice and some slightly burnt malt notes. Surprisingly light for the ABV, but otherwise a very good take on a dubbel.</p>

<p>### An Teallach</p>

<p>The Hector Pretty much black with creamy tan head. Smells quite sweet. Very smooth and creamy with little to no carbonation. Initial sweetness with some bitterness in the finish. A bit bland.</p>

<p>### Anarchy</p>

<p>Dark Apostle Dark brown with a rapidly vanishing head. Aroma has malt and some spice. Flavour also has some hop bitterness and maybe citrus notes. It‚Äôs a bit thin.</p>

<p>### Anchor</p>

<p>Anchor Bock Very dark in colour with a small, bubbly white head. Smells of roasted malts with some sweetness. Tastes thin and burnt. Some sour milk notes. Disappointing, especially from Anchor.</p>

<p>Anchor Christmas ‚Äò11 Dark brown with a small tan head. No real carbonation. Smells of ginger cake with some sweetness. Surprisingly thin, some orange bitterness and a lingering, slightly dry aftertaste. Also some fig roll in the flavour.</p>

<p>Anchor Porter Very dark with a slight caramel aroma. Very fizzy, especially for a porter, although it‚Äôs surprisingly smooth with a strong taste of roasted malts. Strange metallic taste spoils it.</p>

<p>Anchor Steam Beer Dark copper with very little head. Smells of sweet malt with a little hops. Fizzy mouthfeel, well rounded although served quite cold so not a huge amount of taste. Some bitter hops in the aftertaste. Very drinkable and probably also a good session beer.</p>

<p>Christmas Beer 2010 I should point out that I don‚Äôt generally like Christmas beer. And this is no exception. Mid-brown with a tight tan head. Smells of Christmas spices, quite sweet. Much like someone has brewed pot pour. Quite fizzy, tastes like it smells, with lots of clove. Very weird.</p>

<p>Humming Ale Pale yellow with a tight white head. Hoppy aroma with some orange notes. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Taste has some hops and orange with grass and a resiny finish, full of dry and bitter hops. Plenty of hops but manages to stay nicely balanced.</p>

<p>Liberty Ale Light in colour, with an inviting hoppy aroma. Well carbonated, with a hoppy smell, perhaps a touch of fruit. Well balanced combination of malts and bitter hops, the bitterness lasts with a dry finish. Not too complex, and nicely refreshing.</p>

<p>Old Foghorn Dark brown with ruby hints. Small, dark tan head Alcohol notes with some spice and dark fruit. Surprisingly smooth and mellow for the ABV. Lots of roasted malt and dark fruit esters. Spicy alcohol and a little hop in the lingering, dry finish. A little underwhelming for the strength.</p>

<p>### Anderson Valley</p>

<p>Brother David‚Äôs Double Reddish brown. Smells alcoholic and dirty. Tastes similar, with sweetness and more alcohol. Decidedly average.</p>

<p>Hop Ottin IPA Dark copper with a tight white head with good lacing. Good whack of American hops with resin and some dirtiness. Clean tasting, and builds to a nice level of bitterness.</p>

<p>### Angel Ales</p>

<p>Vanilla Sky Clear golden with a foamy white head. No real vanilla taste (which is good in my opinion). Very refreshing with plenty of hops, although it does have a slight soapiness.</p>

<p>### Anheuser-Busch</p>

<p>Budweiser Clear yellow with lots of carbonation. Doesn‚Äôt smell of a lot; some grain and grass. Taste is light with lots of carbonation and some corn. Nothing offensive, but why, just why?</p>

<p>### Aotearoa</p>

<p>Aotearoa Mata Manuka Brewed with Manuka honey. Golden with white head. Smells slightly sweet with some floral and fruit notes. Surprisingly well balanced - the honey doesn‚Äôt dominate too much but is clearly there. Also malt and earthy notes.</p>

<p>### Arbor</p>

<p>Arbor Single Hop Pale golden with good citrus bitterness from the hops. Definite lemon notes and very drinkable.</p>

<p>Breakfast Stout Black with a tan head. Interesting mix of coffee, roasted malt and smoke in the aroma. Coffee and bitterness dominate in the mouth until the aftertaste when it‚Äôs all smoke. Very interesting, and something genuinely different.</p>

<p>Motueka Hazy golden with bubbly white head. Smells of citrus hops. Taste is similar. Very clean and drinkable. Nice.</p>

<p>S-bomb Golden with a very small white head. Grassy citrus hop aroma. Lots of citrus and resin notes in the taste with a nice lingering finish.</p>

<p>Three Little Wolves Slightly hazy brown with bubbly just-off-white head. Spicy hops in the aroma and taste, backed up by lightly toasted malt. Good balance of flavours with a nice lingering slightly spicy finish.</p>

<p>### Archerfield Fine Ales</p>

<p>Dark Ale Dark copper/bronze with no head and large bubbles of carbonation. Smells of sweet malt. Clean and drinkable with roasted and sweet chocolate notes.</p>

<p>### Arkells</p>

<p>Kingsdown Special Dark copper. Smells malty and slightly bitter-sweet. Quite sweet taste with fruity hops in the lingering, bitter finish. Quite dangerously drinkable given the ABV, but a little unexciting.</p>

<p>Moonlight Copper with a very small, off-white head. Smells of malt and dark fruit. Quite thin mouthfeel. Slightly fruity malt flavour. Lingering fruit in the finish. OK.</p>

<p>Wiltshire Gold Pale gold with very small white head. Smells bittersweet. Taste is similar with lingering sweet finish.</p>

<p>### Arran Brewery</p>

<p>Arran Blonde Clear, golden-blonde in colour, with a white head. Smell is mostly hops, as is the taste. Lowe carbonation with a little bitterness and some floral notes. Very summery beer, you could drink a lot of this.</p>

<p>Arran Dark Dark brown rather than black. Aroma is slightly sweet with some caramel and roasted malt. Taste is very similar, with some subtle fruit and hops. It seems simple, but it‚Äôs done very well.</p>

<p>Arran Sunset Pale golden with a frothy white head. Smells of dry hops and malt. Taste is of very dry hops. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Very light and refreshing with a nice dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>Clyde Puffer Dark with define red hues. Tight off-white head. Some sweetness and roast malt in the aroma.  Surprisingly tingly in the mouth. Quite light and sweet. Could do with being smoother. May be a good summer stout.</p>

<p>### Art Brew</p>

<p>Monkey IPA Copper coloured, lots of white lacing. Smells of hops with some spiciness; possibly aniseed. A bit odd, but still pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>Spanked Monkey An IPA with chilli and ginger. Smells of sugar. Very dry and somewhat hoppy with only a very mild chilli undertone. Not too bad.</p>

<p>### Arundel</p>

<p>Trident Amber coloured. Smells a bit dirty amongst the citrus notes. Also tastes a bit dirty, bitter finish is ok though.</p>

<p>### Asahi Breweries</p>

<p>Asahi Super Dry Japanese rice lager. Fizzy head on a straw-coloured clear beer. Mildy bitter and dry. OK but really nothing special.</p>

<p>### Ashover</p>

<p>Liquorice Alesort Made with liquorice root. Rich and black. Full bodied mouthfeel. Don‚Äôt really get the liquorice, more like dark fruit. Still, it‚Äôs a fine stout.</p>

<p>### Asia Pacific Breweries</p>

<p>Tiger Beer Hoppy lager, which is quite crisp with a more rounded aftertaste than you‚Äôd expect. Refreshing and good with a curry.</p>

<p>### Atomic</p>

<p>Grapefruit Smells distinctly of grapefruit. Golden with no head. Clean tasting with some hops and possibly a little citrus. However, I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôd spot it if it wasn‚Äôt obvious from the name.</p>

<p>### Atomic Brewery</p>

<p>Radiation Deep ruby colour. Tastes of alcohol, raisins, alcohol and alcohol. Maybe a touch of bitterness in the finish, but it‚Äôs rather overpowered by the erm, what‚Äôs the word, oh yeah, alcohol.</p>

<p>Strike Apparently an American style pale ale. Golden in colour, with citrus (lemon/grapefruit) aroma. Easy drinking, with citrus and sweet malt. Drying finish.</p>

<p>### Augustiner-Brau Wagner</p>

<p>Augustiner Helles Smells like a helles - some grass, hay and hops. Light golden in colour. Clean, not too fizzy. Taste is mostly grain, with a little grass, so typically lagery, but nice with it.</p>

<p>Augustiner M√ºnchner Dunkel Clear, dark brown and very little head Smells of roasted malt, soy sauce, some smoke and slightly burnt notes. A bit thin and uninteresting; could do with doing a bit more.</p>

<p>Edelstoff This is a seriously good lager. Golden in colour with a large white head. Smells og citrus hops and grass. More complex taste than a typical helles, some lemony hops and grain. Nicely balanced and not too fizzy. Very drinkable, and would be an excellent session beer if you didn‚Äôt mind getting drunk.</p>

<p>Maximator Deep mahogany in colour, with a small, lacy tan head. Smells sweet with caramel, some alcohol, and dark fruit. Taste is sweet malt with soy sauce. Heavy-bodied and doesn‚Äôt really do enough to make it special.</p>

<p>Oktoberfest Clear, very pale gold colour. Smells of lager, with a few alcohol notes. Some creaminess in the taste, along with sweetness and a little hop bitterness. There could well be some orange-citrus in there as well.</p>

<p>### Axholme</p>

<p>Epicurio A Baltic porter. Jet black with small, bubbly, brown head. Loads of dark fruit and roast, chocolatey malt in the aroma. Smells very rich. Huge amount of flavour. Dried fruit, rich malt, a touch of sticky sweetness and a lingering, bitter aftertaste. Very nice!</p>

<p>### Aylesbury Brewhouse Co</p>

<p>Third Switch Smells of roasted malt and coffee. Taste is similar, with some aniseed/spice notes. Aftertaste is very weird with a plasticy taste.</p>

<p>### BAD</p>

<p>Dark Necessities A milk stout. Black with a creamy off-white head. Aroma and flavour have lots of sweetness and roasted malts. Thick mouthfeel with plenty going on. Just what you want from the style.</p>

<p>### BFM (Brasserie des Franches-Montagnes)</p>

<p>\sqrt{225} Saison Cloudy orange with small white head. Lots of funky, sour notes. Tart with some sourness in the finish. It‚Äôs a very good Saison. Not too harsh or funky.</p>

<p>### Bad Co</p>

<p>Whiter Shade of Pale Oatmeal pale ale. Clear golden with small white head. Smells of tropical hops. Very clean and drinkable with similar hops dominating the taste and a nice, subtle bitterness in the finish. Very quaffable.</p>

<p>### Badger</p>

<p>Badger Original Ale Tawny colour, some fizz with a smooth head. Smells of malts and some sweet fruit. Taste is mostly malt, with a hint of fruit and spice, lingering bitter aftertaste.</p>

<p>Blandford Fly Pale amber with some carbonation and a rapidly-vanishing head. Smells of ginger, with some sweetness. Tastes similar and has a fairly sticky mouthfeel. Too much ginger for me.</p>

<p>Dandelion Organic Ale Light golden in colour, with some carbonation and very little head. Smells of the garden ‚Äì very floral with some grassy notes. Has a fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is predominantly floral and herby (think herbal tablets), with some sweetness and a complex mouthfeel.</p>

<p>England‚Äôs Gold Clear golden with hoppy aroma. No head or lacing. Taste is quite fruity, with melon and some lemon. Quite sweet and floral with a medium bitter finish.</p>

<p>First Gold Clear amber with an unexpectedly large white head. Smells malty with some light grass and citrus notes. Flavour is mostly bitter, and comes to a light, refreshing finish. Nicely drinkable, but a little fizzy and unexciting.</p>

<p>Fursty Ferret Amber beer, with a slight hoppy aroma. Well rounded, with a little sweetness and distinctive Badger taste. Very refreshing session beer with a slightly hoppy finish.</p>

<p>Golden Champion Golden with a slight head. Smells of elderflower, with some citrus fruit. Taste is a little sweet, with some fruit and flowers. Nicely bitter finish. Perhaps a little too flowery.</p>

<p>Golden Glory Clear golden with a white head. Aroma has definite peach, but it smells a bit fake. Light tasting otherwise, but dominated by sweetness after a while. Not great.</p>

<p>Hopping Hare Bright, pale golden with white head. As you‚Äôd expect, it‚Äôs pretty hoppy, dominated by citrus and tangy bitterness. Very drinkable and exactly what you‚Äôd expect from a Badger beer.</p>

<p>Poachers Choice Reddish brown. Tastes of fruit and liquorice. Reminds me a lot of snakebite and black.</p>

<p>River Cottage Stinger Yellow gold with a white head. Aroma is grassy with something else green, that I presume it‚Äôs the nettles. Light bodied and slightly watery. However, it‚Äôs very refreshing with a nice bitterness to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>Tanglefoot Copper coloured, with a cereal smell, and the distinctive Badger aroma. Quite fizzy, yet very drinkable and refreshing. Notes of fruit (melon/pear/peach), but not overwhelming.</p>

<p>Wicked Wyvern Copper with a medium head. Smells of citrus hops with some malt and light resin. Taste is similar, medium bitterness and quite a lot of fizz. Drinkable.</p>

<p>### Badische Staatsbruauerei Rothaus</p>

<p>Rothaus Hefe Weizen Hazy straw coloured with a foamy white head which disappears surprisingly quickly. Smells bready with a little pineapple and some yeast. Taste is dryer and more acidic than I was expecting. Still, a pretty good weissbier.</p>

<p>Rothaus M√§rzen Export Golden with moderate carbonation and a largish white foamy head. Smells of hay and hope with a little sweetness. Taste is similar, a bit of a standard M√§rzen, but very well balanced. Not too fizzy and pretty fresh.</p>

<p>Rothaus Pils Very clear yellow/golde with a small white head which vanishes pretty quickly. Smells dry with hops and some sweetness, much as you‚Äôd expect from a pils. Nice grainy taste with some balancing hops and a bitter aftertaste. Somewhat light in body, but nicely refreshing.</p>

<p>### Banff Ave. Brewing Co.</p>

<p>Berry Blonde Slightly red with no head. More tart than sweet fruit. Very clean and drinkable.</p>

<p>Blonde Ale Hazy light golden with a very small white head. A bit dull but would be a good session beer if there‚Äôs nothing better available. Hints of an un-spiced Belgian wit.</p>

<p>Cascadian Dark Very dark with a creamy tan head. Smells of floral and citrus hops. Taste similar, with roasted malts and a full hop flavour. Very nice.</p>

<p>Lower Bankhead Black Pilsner Dark brown, looks like a dunkel with no head. Doesn‚Äôt smell of a whole lot. Tastes a little burnt with some crisp hoppiness in the finish.</p>

<p>Rev. Rundle Stout Very very dark brown with a creamy off-white head. Smells strongly of roasted malt. Very creamy in the mouth (nitrogen infused) with good roast malt flavour.</p>

<p>### Bank Top</p>

<p>Bank Top Blonde Very pale. Smells weird - wood/something else. Ok taste, but slightly astringent finish spoils it somewhat.</p>

<p>### Bank‚Äôs</p>

<p>Bank‚Äôs Mild Mid-brown with a foamy, slightly tan head. Aroma is roasted malt. Slightly fizzy with a little bitterness. Medium body, mostly roasted malts, and lacks slightly in other flavour.</p>

<p>Bank‚Äôs Original Slightly sweet, almost fruity. Otherwise, very generic, with an smoothflow style head. Seems to be catering to the masses; there are so many better beers out there.</p>

<p>### Banks and Taylor</p>

<p>Black Dragon Mild Black with a small, just-off white head. Aroma and taste have lots of roast malt. This is almost like a stout. Very nice.</p>

<p>Dragons Gold Pale golden. Smells slightly spicy with some sweetness. Taste is similar with slight alcohol notes and some hoppiness in the finish.</p>

<p>Fruit Bat Straw coloured with a malty, fruity and flowery aroma. Taste is similar with a light hoppiness with some soft fruit and a building maltiness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Barney‚Äôs</p>

<p>Capital Porter Pretty much black with small tan head. Smells chocolatey. Quite fizzy. Lots of roasted malt and a clean, bitter finish with light chocolate notes.</p>

<p>Genius Loki Golden with tight white head. Some hop and vegetal aroma. Clean with a nice bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Good Ordinary Pale Ale Golden with tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Very drinkable. Certainly matches its name very well and would be an excellent summer session beer.</p>

<p>Lapsang Smoked Porter Very dark brown with small off-white head. Definitely smells smoky. Quite dry in the mouth with plenty of smoke, especially in the lingering finish. Bitterness builds after a while. A very nice rauchbier.</p>

<p>Red Rye Dark reddish brown. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is slightly sweet with some spice and malt. Decent but unspectacular.</p>

<p>Vital Juices Golden with white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma of citrus and pine. Taste has more citrus and some hop bitterness. Described as a session IPA, and that‚Äôs pretty much exactly what it is.</p>

<p>Volcano IPA Golden with lots of bubbles and a bubbly white head. Fruity hops in the aroma. Lots of dry hops in the taste, balanced by some fruitiness in the finish and then returning to a long dry aftertaste. Almost some menthol as well. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Barnsley Beer Company</p>

<p>Shut Thi Gob Dark copper with no carbonation (although it had been left to stand for a while). Very little aroma although there‚Äôs a hint of medicine sharpness in the background. Dull and watery; tastes very thin. However, it is very downable.</p>

<p>### Basqueland and Lervig</p>

<p>No‚Äôrway Jose IPA Slightly hazy orange-gold with fine white head. Tropical fruit and resinous hops in the aroma. Loads of fruit in the taste with a drying bitterness in the finish and lingering resin hops. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Bateman‚Äôs</p>

<p>Dark Mild Oddly, but not offensively, bitter for a mild. Low strength, combined with a reasonable taste leads to a good session beer; not overly exciting though.</p>

<p>England Expects Dark brown with a caramel sweetness in both the aroma and taste. Slight dryness in the finish, along with some residual bitterness.</p>

<p>Summer Swallow Clear golden, small white head. Smells slightly dirty with a little biscuity lightly roast malt. Maybe also some grass notes. Odd, metallic and grass taste. Almost lager-like.</p>

<p>Victory Ale Light copper with a frothy white head. A spicy (pepper?) malty aroma. Well rounded with a nice hop bitterness in the finish. Fizzy mouthfeel with some alcohol notes.</p>

<p>XXXB Copper-red with a frothy white head. Spicey hops and malt in the aroma, also some caramel sweetness. Taste is similar to the smell, with a long aftertaste dominated by spicy hops. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel.</p>

<p>Yella Belly Golden. Apparently brewed with lager malt and Chinook and Cascade hops. Seems, however, to have been brewed with vegetables and an odd mix of chemicals, which is all it really tastes and smells of. Dirty.</p>

<p>### Bath Ales</p>

<p>Barnstormer Dark with reddish-purple tinges and a slightly off-white head. Smells sweet and a bit spicy. Taste is well rounded with some chocolate notes and a bit of hop flavour.</p>

<p>Dark Hare Very dark brown with a tan head, which vanishes almost immediately. Smells quite sweet with plenty of roasted malt and a light burnt note. Taste is very heavy and rounded with roasted malts followed by a hint of sweetness and a nice hoppy aftertaste, which leads to a dry finish.</p>

<p>Gem Crystal clear orangey-brown. Smells of biscuity malts with some caramel sweetness. Taste is spicy hops with bread notes. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Golden Hare As the name suggests, pale golden in colour. Thick foamy white head which disappears quite quickly. Smells of light malt with some undertones of tropical fruit. Taste is light grassy hops with some floral notes and light malt. Slight bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Wild Hare Organic golden pale ale, according to the bottle. Pours cloudy with thin white head and no real carbonation. Smells of citrusy hops, which come through in the taste with some dryness. No real depth though.</p>

<p>### Battlefield (Tunnel)</p>

<p>Richard III Plantagenet Smells rich. Tastes absolutely awful. Much stronger in taste than the ABV would suggest. Tastes that, instead of being brewed, it‚Äôs orange sludge that‚Äôs been left in a vat to die.</p>

<p>### Beavertown</p>

<p>Birds of a Feather Pale golden with fine streams of carbonation and no head. Aroma is funky with some fruit notes, maybe gooseberry. Taste also has some funk. It‚Äôs crisp and dry with sour fruit and some bitterness. Interesting.</p>

<p>Holy Stout Tan head. Rich and smooth with coffee notes with some sweetness. Very sweet but also very drinkable.</p>

<p>Neck Oil Hazy yellow with tight white head. Aroma dominated by citrus - lemon and grapefruit. Taste is similar. Mouthfeel is a bit thin with moderate carbonation, but there‚Äôs still quite a lot of citrus flavour and a light bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Smog Rocket Smoked porter. Black with a sticky, off-white head. Light smoke and roasted malt in the aroma. Surprisingly fizzy mouthfeel. Very clean with a subtly subtle smoke flavour. Tastes much lighter than it looks.</p>

<p>### Bedlam</p>

<p>IPA Orange-golden with quite a sharp, hoppy aroma. Taste is similar - well-hopped with a good bitterness in the finish. Clean and very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Beer Geek Brewery</p>

<p>Dark Side of the Geek Slight red hints to a dark-brown body with a sticky, very slightly off-white head. Smells of roasted malts with some dry, chocolate and malt, with something weird added in. Taste is a bit thin and disjointed, it‚Äôs not bad, just unexciting.</p>

<p>Geek Unique Dark copper with a thin, foamy head. Smells a bit gee. Tastes unfinished. Not all that much going on, and what there is isn‚Äôt very nice.</p>

<p>Geek Unique Special Mid brown in colour. Smells slightly bittersweet, although there‚Äôs not a lot of aroma. Taste has sweet malt and some building fruitiness and biscuity malt in the finish.</p>

<p>Great White Geek Clear, orangey golden with a white, foamy head. Not a huge amont of aroma. Tastes musty and slightly off.</p>

<p>### Beerbliotek</p>

<p>I Am Everyday People Described as a session IPA. Hazy, light yellow with a white head. Aroma of citrus and pine. Taste has a citrus bitterness. Light bodied with minimal carbonation. Very good for a low ABV session beer.</p>

<p>### Beijing Yanjing Beer Group</p>

<p>Yanjing Clear golden with large amounts of carbonation and a small white head. Smells very light with a bit of sweetness. Taste is again very light. Easy to drink on a hot day, but generally bland and unexciting.</p>

<p>Yanjing Ice Beer Very difficult to spot the difference between this and the standard Yanjing; perhaps this is a bit lighter, but it‚Äôs hard to tell.</p>

<p>Yanjing Stout Dark brown, with hints of red. Small, tan head with a reasonable amount of carbonation. Smells of roasted malt, with some burnt notes and a bit of sourness. Taste is similar; it‚Äôs a bit like a dunkel or schwarzbier rather than a stout. Not brilliant, but much better than the standard lager offerings in China.</p>

<p>### Belhaven</p>

<p>Belhaven 80/- A bit of a generic smooth-flow like bitter on tap. I‚Äôd like to try the bottled version.</p>

<p>Belhaven Black Very dark, almost black with a light tan head. Smells rich and roasted with a full and creamy mouthfeel with a little tingle. Lots of roast malts with a slightly bitter finish to round things off. Very nice.</p>

<p>Bridge to Nowhere Golden with quite a lot of fizz. Not a huge amount of head. Tropical fruit hops and bitterness in the nose. Taste is mostly bitterness with a little light malt. Drinkable with a nice finish.</p>

<p>Golden Bay Gold with a white head. Malty aroma and taste, with a building bitterness. Bittersweet finish.</p>

<p>Grand Slam Golden with a finger or so of white head. Smells of light malt and hops, with a hint of sweetness. Similar flavours with a nice level of carbonation. Very drinkable and a fine session beer.</p>

<p>Robert Burns Brown Ale Chestnut brown with no head. A bit of malt and sweetness in the aroma. Taste is similar; just what you expect from a brown ale. Quite subtle, but drinkable.</p>

<p>Scottish Oat Stout Jet black with small light brown head. Smells of roasted make with some salt? Taste is rich and complex with coffee and chocolate sweetness backed up by a bitter finish. Quite tingly with alcohol notes.</p>

<p>Speyside Oak Aged Blonde Ale Golden with a definite oak and vanilla aroma and notes of whisky. Taste is sweet vanilla with a sticky mouthfeel. Not sold on it at all.</p>

<p>St Andrew‚Äôs Ale Copper with no head. Smells malty with some sweetness. Tastes like a dull version of Newcastle Brown.</p>

<p>St. Andrews Ale Copper coloured. Quite fizzy with sweet malt. Very generic, but drinkable.</p>

<p>Twisted Thistle Golden yellow with fine white bubbles of head. Slight grapefruit citrus aroma. Quite bitter with a good fizz and a building grapefruit aftertaste. Pretty good but nothing outstanding.</p>

<p>### Bellfield Brewery</p>

<p>Lawless Village IPA Gluten free. Copper coloured. Malt and citrus hops on the nose. Clean with some dryness and light fruit notes. A slightly tingly, bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Berliner Kindl Brauerei</p>

<p>Berliner Kindl Weisse Pale, hazy yellow colour, with a rapidly dissolving head. Very fizzy. Smell and taste are very sour, with lemon and almost-vinegar notes. Long sour finish. Think lemon gueuze or alcoholic lemonade.</p>

<p>Berliner Pilsner Yep, it‚Äôs a pils. Quite a sharp one.</p>

<p>### Bernard</p>

<p>Bernard Amber Free This is surprisingly good. There‚Äôs lots of malt going on, which helps to mask the usual alcohol-free notes. It‚Äôs a bit like a dark Newcastle Brown. Quite sweet with malt notes and a bit if carbonation.</p>

<p>### Bexley</p>

<p>Bexley‚Äôs Own Beer Brown. Has fruity (apple) notes and some hops. Building bitter finish. Drinkable but nothing special.</p>

<p>### Bierbrouwerij De Koningshoeven</p>

<p>La Trappe Blond Golden amber colour with little head. Some alcohol notes in the aroma with a mild hoppiness. Some yeast and spice notes. Taste is sweet malts with some herbal notes. Medium body and carbonation gives it a clean finish, although also slightly syrupy overall. I‚Äôd much prefer a Vedett White.</p>

<p>La Trappe Dubbel Dark brown with a finger of tan head which vanishes to lacing quite quickly. Caramel malt aroma, with some dark fruits. Taste is sweeter than I expected, perhaps dark fruit. Some alcohol notes. Reasonably drinkable but unexciting.</p>

<p>La Trappe Isid‚Äôor Medium brown, hazy with a small, tight head with little lacing. Smells of malt and perhaps a little fruit, some candy sugar. Slightly creamy with a smooth mouthfeel and a little spice in the finish. Some peach flavours with a little sugar sweetness. I found this to be a bit dull.</p>

<p>La Trappe Quadrupel An oak aged Trappist beer. Copper-red colour with small off-white head. Lots of aroma, mostly malts, with some fruit sweetness. Flavour is roasted malts with some dark fruits and a little grass/wood. Medium carbonation with a dry finish. Expensive, but my favourite La Trappe.</p>

<p>La Trappe Tripel Deep amber colour with minimal head but some thick lacing. Smells of Belgian candy sugar with some hints of fruit. Taste is quite sweets, with some malts and candy sugar again. Some alcohol notes and a reasonably thick mouthfeel. Not a bad triple but not a brilliant one either.</p>

<p>La Trappe Witte Hazy straw colour with a large bubbly head which vanishes quite quickly. Aroma is wheat with some banana and a little spice. Medium bodied with some sweetness and spice (coriander?). Hints of citrus. Fresh finish.</p>

<p>### Bierbrouwerij Sint Christoffel</p>

<p>Christoffel Blonde Pale, hazy golden in colour with small head that fades to lacing. Smells of apples, maybe some honey sweetness. Tastes mostly bready with some apple tartness. Slightly metallic aftertaste, but other than that quite well-balanced and the apple makes it refreshing</p>

<p>Christoffel Robertus Very dark brown with a small tan head. Good carbonation with a malty, slightly sweet aroma with some alcohol notes. Roasted malt flavour but gets boring very quickly.</p>

<p>### Bieres de Chimay</p>

<p>Chimay Blue Mahogany colour with a small tan head, which has a little lacing. Smells of alcohol, raisin-like fruit and brown sugar. Tastes similar, with some rum notes and dark fruit accompanying the bready malt. Definite alcohol, but very well rounded and very enjoyable.</p>

<p>Chimay Red Amber-red with a slightly-off-white head, which has very good retention and lacing. Smooth mouthfeel despite the high level of carbonation. Smells sweet with some peppery spice. Taste is mostly malt with some hops in the background providing a nice balance. Slightly sour aftertaste.</p>

<p>Chimay White Hazy orange with a creamy white head. Smells clean, with some spice notes. Smooth yet crisp mouthfeel. More alcohol than you‚Äôd expect in the taste, along with some crisp dryness and malt sweetness. Good, but not outstanding.</p>

<p>Cinq Cents Clear golden with large frothy white head. Smells yeasty and dry. Spicy and sweet. Complex and drinkable.</p>

<p>Mont des Cats Smells alcoholic with some spice. Taste is mainly banana. Dark copper/brown with a very small white head. More like a weissbier than a trappist, but pretty good.</p>

<p>### Big Lamp Brewery</p>

<p>Keelman Brown Very dark brown with reddish hues and a just off-white head. Roasted malt, some nuttiness and alcohol in the aroma. Very smooth with some toffee sweetness and a lingering light bitterness. Mmm‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Pele‚Äôs Pint Golden with tight white head. Smells slightly flower. Nice mix of floral and fruity hops leading to a dry finish. Excellent after a long walk!</p>

<p>Premium Bitter Dark copper. Dominated by dark frit and alcohol. Slightly unbalanced but still drinkable.</p>

<p>Prince Bishop Ale Golden with tight white head. Smells rich and fruity with some alcohol notes. Very clean tasting with fruity hop bitterness. A good pint but could do a bit more given the abv.</p>

<p>Summerhill Stout Jet black with off-white head. Roasted malt with coffee in both the nose and mouth. Leading to a roasted finish.</p>

<p>Sunny Daze Pale golden with tight white head. Clean and bitter. Pretty standard.</p>

<p>### Big Rock Brewery</p>

<p>Big Rock IPA Dark golden with a very fine white head. Smells of resinous and slightly floral hops. Taste is similar with some dry bitterness and a slight tingle in the mouth. Very nice.</p>

<p>Grasshopper Pale golden with small bubbles of white head. Not a huge amount of aroma or taste, but clean and would be a good session beer. Quite like a light helles.</p>

<p>### Big Shed Brewery</p>

<p>Rocky Mountain Golden with loads of American style hops in the aroma. Well balanced, refreshing and a good body and mouthfeel. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Birra Menabrea</p>

<p>Menabrea Clear golden with fine streams of carbonation and a patchy white head. Smells grassy. Tastes similar with a little sweetness and some dry spicing. Not bad, especially for a pale lager.</p>

<p>### Bitburger</p>

<p>Bitburger Pils A fairly average pils, but that doesn‚Äôt stop it being very drinkable if you fancy something light. Refreshing, but definitely not exciting.</p>

<p>### Black Dog</p>

<p>Bite Pale golden. Smells of grassy hops. Good hit of bitterness in an otherwise slightly grassy and clean lager.</p>

<p>Chomp Copper with lacy white head. Smells a bit green. Tastes quite like a fizzy generic bitter with some sweetness followed by a bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Black Hole Brewery</p>

<p>Milky Way Light golden in colour, with large head and little aroma. Taste is light citrus, drinkable but unexciting.</p>

<p>### Black Iris</p>

<p>Circle of Snakes Hazy yellow. Lots of tropical fruit notes in the aroma. Taste has citrus and grapefruit with a sweet finish. Possibly not with the ABV. A bit sticky.</p>

<p>### Black Isle</p>

<p>20 Hours of Daylight Rhubarb and elderflower. Pale golden with small white head with lots of lacing. Smells sweet and sour, with rhubarb notes. Taste is mostly fruit with some sourness and a sweet finish. A little bit of fizz. Could almost be a cider.</p>

<p>23 Trees Light golden with quite a lot of carbonation. Citrus and pine aroma. Slightly sweet with malt, some citrus zest, plenty of spice and a peppery finish. A bit sticky.</p>

<p>Goldfinch Clear golden with a tight white head. Light bitter and fruity hop aroma. Taste is similar - not a powerfully hopped IPA, but very clean and drinkable. A slight fizz to the finish. Wouldn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs gluten free.</p>

<p>Hibernator Dark black with small creamy tan head. Creamy with a slight tingle and a touch of alcohol. Roast malt and some dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>Migrator Dark copper with a slight haze. Frothy white head. Aroma of tropical fruit. Full taste with malt and a hit of resinous hops and a bitter finish. Quite fizzy.</p>

<p>Organic Porter Unsurprisingly black with a very large, frothy Duvel-style head. Smells of roasted malt, which is also dominant in the mouth. Also some smoke and earthy notes. Overall it‚Äôs clean and light but with plenty of flavour and well-balanced.</p>

<p>Red Kite Ale Red-brown with bubbly off-white head. Smells sweet with some fruity hops. Very fizzy. Malt is dominant with faint hop notes. Not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>Yellowhammer Pale golden with very little head. Light, fresh hop aroma. Taste is also light and refreshing with a nice hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Black Metal Brewery</p>

<p>Will-o‚Äô-the-Wisp Mid brown with small off-white head. Very light smoke in the nose. Some fizz and definite alcohol in the initial taste. Smoke slowly builds, leading to a lingering aftertaste. A good introductory smoked beer. Don‚Äôt really get any of the juniper.</p>

<p>### Black Rock</p>

<p>Pale Ale Light golden. Slight hop aroma. Has tropical fruit, honey and earthy malts. Taste slightly dirty but builds to a perfectly OK beer.</p>

<p>### Black Sheep</p>

<p>Baa Baa It‚Äôs a very standard golden ale. Some tropical fruit and citrus aroma. Bitter and tangy, but a bit samey as it goes on.</p>

<p>Black Sheep Ale Dark amber with a reasonable head. Smells mostly of malt, and a little sweet. Lightly carbonated, with some mild hops. Very dry aftertaste.</p>

<p>Choc Orange Stout Jet black with creamy off-white white head. Smells bitter with some fruit notes. Not a huge amount of orange, but definite bitterness.</p>

<p>Golden Sheep Golden/amber with a very small white head and a lot of bubbles of carbonation. Smells sweet with light malt and some grassy notes. Initially a bit sweet but quickly overtaken by bitter hops, and a dry, fruity finish. Easy drinking.</p>

<p>Imperial Russian Stout Black with a reddish tinge. Looks like coke. Smells of rich, dark fruit with some alcohol notes. Some red wine notes; very much like port. Excellent.</p>

<p>Imperial Russian Stout This is a proper Imperial stout. Deep brown with a light brown head. Aroma is well balanced with bitterness, roast malt, some alcohol. Full bodied and a bit sticky. Starts a bit sweet and ends with a lingering bitterness.</p>

<p>Monty Python‚Äôs Holy Grail Honey/copper/straw coloured. Not a whole lot of smell, perhaps some grassiness. Slightly sour, with a weird blue cheese saltiness. No real aftertaste.</p>

<p>Ram Tackle It‚Äôs a generic bitter with hints of smooth flow. OK.</p>

<p>Riggwelter Brown ale with large white head. Good aroma, smells somewhat bitter. Malt dominates the taste with plenty of bitterness. Good mouthfeel with a nice level of carbonation. Very drinkable with a cleansing bitter finish.</p>

<p>Sainsbury‚Äôs Yorkshire Bitter Bronze colour with a strong malt aroma. Taste also has lots of malt with some dry hops. Generic, and lacking a little in the hop department, but still drinkable.</p>

<p>Yorkshire Square Ale Dark amber with a thin head. Smells sharp with grain notes. Taste is initially grass and lemon with bitter hops and then some pepperiness. Quite smooth and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Black Wolf</p>

<p>Lomond Gold Golden yellow with fizzy white head. Zesty floral aroma. Sweet and malty with some floral and fruity notes in the finish. Quite tingly.</p>

<p>### Blackfriars</p>

<p>Whyte Angel Pale golden with a tight white head. Smells vegetable. Some malt and sour bitterness in the taste. Not all that pleasant.</p>

<p>### Blackhill</p>

<p>Top Busty Amber in colour. Smells slightly like homebrew. Taste is quite bitter, and it certainly tastes darker than it looks.</p>

<p>### Blackjack</p>

<p>First Deal Dark amber in colour. Smells of fruity, lemony hops. Taste is similar, quite full in the mouth with some citrus and sweetness, giving a slightly cheesecake like taste. Definite citrus in the finish.</p>

<p>### Blindmans</p>

<p>Beer Goggles Looks like a generic bitter. Tastes like a slightly hoppy generic bitter.</p>

<p>### Blue Anchor</p>

<p>Spingo Special Originally brewed to celebrate the marriage of Charles and Diana. Dark in colour. Smells earthy with some dark fruit. Taste is dominated by fruit and peppery hops, with some port. Finish is long with similar malt, fruit and hop flavours.</p>

<p>### Blue Monkey</p>

<p>Ape Ale Pale golden with frothy white head. Smells and tastes hoppy.  Very nice.</p>

<p>### Blythe</p>

<p>Johnsons Black with a thick head. Smells a bit sweet, like a milk stout. Full-bodied and smooth with chocolate, smoke and liquorice. Finish is a little bitter with some coffee notes.</p>

<p>### Boggart Hole Clough</p>

<p>Blue For 2 Mid-golden in colour with a frothy white head. Smells of hops and light malt. Tastes of biscuity malt with some citrus hops and a nice smoothness. No hop dryness in the finish, which is slightly disappointed. A little unexciting, but still very drinkable.</p>

<p>Rum Porter Very dark black with a small tan, frothy head. Smells sweet like rum truffle chocolates (expensive ones). Very smooth with some roasted flavour and a sweetness like liquer chocolates. A nice porter which for once isn‚Äôt overpowered by the rum.</p>

<p>### Born in the Borders</p>

<p>Elderflower Very pale with bubbly white head. Smells very weird. Tastes of elderflower. Quite sweet and sticky with a bitter and malty finish.</p>

<p>Game Bird Dark golden with virtually no head. Malty with some fruit in the aroma. Quite thin. Dominated by sweet malt and fruitiness. Pretty unremarkable.</p>

<p>Holy Cow Bronze in colour with frothy white head that leaves good lacing. Not a huge about of aroma. Tastes predominantly bitter with some spice in the finish. Pretty generic chestnut bitter.</p>

<p>### Boston Beer Company</p>

<p>Infinium Pale golden, lots of fine bubbles and a fizzy white head. Smells quite like salt and vinegar crisps, with some yeast and marmite notes. Also some alcohol and sugary sweetness. Quite complex tasting, but nothing really distinct, maybe some apple and spice. Nice and clean in the finish.</p>

<p>Samuel Adams Boston Lager Light amber with a rocky head. Smells sweet with some floral hops. Tastes similar, with some caramel and a slightly spicy hoppy finish. Could do with more malt and less grain flavour.</p>

<p>### Boundary</p>

<p>Gift 1 Very dark black with tan head that disappears quite quickly. Roasted aroma with some alcohol and maybe spice notes. Quite a tingly mouthfeel. Definite alcohol along with some sweetness and a background of roasted malt. Aftertaste of alcohol and roasted flavours.</p>

<p>### Boundary Road</p>

<p>American Pale Ale Golden with white head. Smells and tastes of citrus hops, with a very crisp finish and a lingering dryness that is well balanced by the fruit.</p>

<p>Arabica Dabra Very dark with tan head. Definite aroma and taste of coffee. Roast malt as well. A little too bitter, especially in the finish.</p>

<p>Flying Fortress Dark golden. Loads of malt and bittersweet happiness in the taste. Like an ESB, especially the caramel sweetness.</p>

<p>Jack The Sipper Nearly black with bubbly off-white head. Smells of chocolate and coffee. Roasted malt, sweetness and chocolate aftertaste combine with a tingly mouthfeel to make a very drinkable London porter.</p>

<p>The Chosen One Golden with small white head. Not much aroma. Quite sweet with a little malt but not much else going on. At least it‚Äôs not too fizzy.</p>

<p>### Bowmans</p>

<p>Eldorado Brewed with elderflower. Tastes somewhat fruity but not too sweet. Well rounded. Probably a good summer beer. Has a looooooong aftertaste.</p>

<p>Nutz Brewed with French chestnuts. Chestnut colour, with chestnut aromas and does actually taste of nuts, which is a pleasant surprise. Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want more than one of these in a session though.</p>

<p>### Box Steam</p>

<p>Derail Ale Light copper with a finger of white foamy head. Very little aroma. Some slight fizz in the mouthfeel. A little malt and a drying hop finish. Drinkable but a bit watery.</p>

<p>Steam Porter Black with red hues and a tan head. Lots of roast coffee aroma. Creamy mouthfeel with some smoke, but nowhere near as much taste as you‚Äôd expect from a porter. May have been served too cold.</p>

<p>### Bradfield</p>

<p>Brown Cow Chestnut brown with an caramel aroma. Caramel in the mouth as well, some roast malts, but not enough to combat the sweetness. Roast finish,</p>

<p>Farmer‚Äôs Stout Very dark with a foamy white head. Smells of roasted malt and oats. Tastes similar, with dryness from the malt and a smoothness from the oats. A lingering roast finish makes this a very drinkable stout.</p>

<p>### Brakspear</p>

<p>Brakspear Bitter A bitter that genuinely lives up to its name, it is very bitter. A hint of malt, in both aroma and taste, provides some balance. I‚Äôd enjoy it as a session beer.</p>

<p>Brakspear Tripel Reddish brown with a thin head. Smells of toffee, malts and some dark fruit. There‚Äôs a definite alcohol smell. Nice crisp carbonation, tastes of roasted malts and alcohol, with a slight sweetness. Makes very good batter.</p>

<p>Oxford Gold Golden colour, clear with a thick finger of head with good lacing. Smell is sweet and hoppy, taste is similar, although it only has a mild bitterness. Very drinkable and well balanced, lacking some excitement though.</p>

<p>### Branscombe Vale</p>

<p>Branoc Copper with a smoothflow-style head. Sweet malt aroma. Clean taste with some sweetness mixed with a refreshing malty bitterness.</p>

<p>Draymans Best Bitter Dark golden with an aroma of biscuity malt. Notes of caramel, along with more biscuity malt and a decent bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Brass Castle Brewery</p>

<p>Northern Blonde Golden. Slightly yeasty aroma, along with some slightly sour and fruity notes. Sweet, with some sour notes. It‚Äôs ok.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Almaza</p>

<p>Almaza Fizzy lager, smells of lager with some mall and a little sweetness. Slightly dry finish. Better than Peroni.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Artisanale De Rull√©s</p>

<p>Cuv√©e Meilleurs Voeux Hazy brown with a small, slightly off-white head, which leaves some lacing. Smells of alcohol with sweet, dark fruit. Some caramel and burnt malt in the taste. Too sweet and doesn‚Äôt really do enough.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Artisanale Millevertus</p>

<p>La Mac Vertus Very dark and opaque. Slightly off-white, creamy head. Smells of dark fruit and roasted malt. Surprisingly smooth mouthfeel. Initially sweet with a roasted, almost burnt finish. Quite dry and surprisingly rich, full and stouty for a Belgian stout.</p>

<p>La M√®re Vertus Very hazy with a small froth of white head. Smells sweet and fruity with pineapple candy notes. Some malty notes as well. Strong and malty taste, and nowhere near as sweet as you expect from the aroma. Some wheat notes and a little fizz in the mouth. Definite yeast as well. Probably too strong and definitely not subtle.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Cantillon</p>

<p>Cantillon Gueuze Lambic Hazy golden with good carbonation and a fizzy head when disturbed. Smells yeasty and slightly, but not too, sour. Very clean, with a nice level of grapefruit sourness. Very well balanced and packed with flavour. The benchmark gueuze.</p>

<p>Cantillon Iris Very hazy dark golden. Smells slightly sour with Belgian yeast notes. Quite a sour taste, but very well-balanced with sourness and fruit sweetness. An excellent, complex, wheat-free Lambic.</p>

<p>Mamouche Very hazy light golden. Definitely smells like a gueuze/lambic with lots of yeasty funk and sourness. Taste is very intense, with dry cider notes. Really cleverly balanced sourness, with elderflower notes and some tannins. This is a seriously excellent beer. The taste hits you even before it gets to your mouth.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Caracole</p>

<p>Forestinne Ambrosia Copper with a small white head. Standard Belgian aroma, with some spice and lots of sweetness. Taste is very similar, with a lingering, sticky finish, which gets a bit unpleasant after a while.</p>

<p>Forestinne Mysteria Golden, slightly hazy with a small, bubbly white head that leaves good lacing. Huge amount of aroma, with lots of tropical fruits. Some fizz in the mouth but quite smooth. Taste is fruity with a sweet aftertaste, some alcohol and spice (pepper) in the finish. Flavour is much more rounded than the aroma. Like marmalade on brown toast.</p>

<p>Forestinne Nordika Very slight haze to the golden colour with white bubbles of head around the sides of the glass. Smells of orange with nutmeg, aniseed and cinnamon. Taste is similar; lightly spiced with some orange and a menthol-like finish. Quite thin and a bit weird.</p>

<p>Nostradamus Medium brown, with some haziness and a very large white head. Variable lacing. Smells of alcohol and some dark fruits, has a port-like quality. Fairly fizzy mouthfeel, with some sweetness and noticeable alcohol. Very drinkable, but certainly not a session beer!</p>

<p>Troublette Light golden, very hazy with frothy white head. Smells of cider vinegar crisps. Taste is clean with a little spice and some gooseberry sourness in the finish. Quite spritzy in the mouth. Would be a great summer beer-garden beer.</p>

<p>### Brasserie D‚ÄôEbly</p>

<p>La Corne Pretty average Belgian pale ale, not a lot else to say.</p>

<p>### Brasserie D‚ÄôEcaussinnes</p>

<p>Cookie Beer Light copper with a tight white head. Smells of pot pouri. Very odd taste. Sweet, banana, lavender, honey/caramel and some pine resin in the finish. Gets quite sticky and is overly complicated.</p>

<p>### Brasserie De Cazeau</p>

<p>Cazeau Tournay Noire Very black, with a large, bubbly, slightly off-white head. Smells quite bitter with roasted notes. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Taste has dark malt with some light burnt notes and a little alcohol. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Brasserie De Saint-Sylvestre</p>

<p>3 Monts Cork makes a satisfying pop. Clear, light golden with fine streams of carbonation and a large, rocky white head. Smells of bready malts. Taste is initially a bit odd, with grassy grain, citrus, lots of alcohol, and a bit of fun. Overcarbonated and a strange metallic note. Also a little bit sticky.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Des Garrigues</p>

<p>Nuit Du Goguetter Jet black with a very small ring of tan head. Smells a little burnt and bitter. Quite thin with not a lot other than roasted malt and a little coffee.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Des Geants</p>

<p>Gouyasse Tradition Hazy golden, thin white head with good lacing. Some sweetness and possibly a little fruit in the smell. Quite clean, no real malt, maybe a bit of banana. Some fizz on the tongue. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Gouyasse Tripel Pale golden, slightly hazy with a small white head. Not too much lacing. SOme candy sweetness with a vegetable/compost smell. Fizzy mouthfeel, with a clean, dry aftertaste. Some orange citrus.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Du Bocq</p>

<p>Bocq Christmas Dark brown, with a good, slightly tan head. Taste is full, with spice and lots of dark malt. Interesting enough to be drinkable.</p>

<p>Broeder Jacob Dubbel Port Very dark with a large, frothy white head. Smells sweet with dark fruit and alcohol notes. Tingly, and very full in the mouth with a sticky sweetness, dark, rich fruit and alcohol. A nice dark sipping beer.</p>

<p>Deugniet Golden with a haze of white head. Smells alcoholic and slightly fruity. Clean but a bit dull. Underwhelming, especially given the ABV.</p>

<p>Queue De Charrue Amber (Ploegsteert) Orange-brown, hazy, with a small white head. Some citrus (orange) in the nose along with some alcohol. Not a huge amount of aroma. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is slightly sweet, with orange and then a little sourness and a crisp, dry finish. Pretty boring.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Dubuisson Freres</p>

<p>Prestige Fizzy, copper coloured (almost orange), with a tan head. Smells quite like a gueuze, with the associated sourness. Tastes alcoholic (unsurprisingly) withs some dark fruit and a little sticky sweetness. Some hop bitterness balances it out. Very nice, and definitely a sipping beer.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Dupont</p>

<p>Biol√©g√®re Golden in colour. Smells malty and slightly fruity. Taste is very surprising with a lot going on. Malt and yeast with some apple-like fruit and honey sweetness. Manages to stay quite light, like a light Duvel. Would be a good lunchtime tipple.</p>

<p>Bons Voeux Clear and golden, with a vanishing white head with good lacing. Smells of fruit, bitter malt and some hops. Light and crisp, with some alcohol notes and a little fruit. Like good champagne. Name means ‚Äòbest wishes‚Äô. Vert drinkable, although it‚Äôs a Christmas special, would probably be good in the summer.</p>

<p>Monk‚Äôs Stout Very dark red, almost black. Large tan head after the pour. Smells dry, however the taste isn‚Äôt anywhere near as dry as the nose suggests. Moderate roasted malt and quite fizzy and a bit thin.</p>

<p>Saison Dupont Slightly hazy golden with a tight white head. Smells earthy with some pear notes. Fruity phenols, yeast and Belgian candy-sugar sweetness. Very smooth with a good crispness in the finish. Some alcohol notes, but they‚Äôre not overpowering.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Ellezelloise</p>

<p>Hercule Stout An exceptional stout. Very dark, opaque, with some coffee and chocolate aromas. Very complex taste, dark chocolate, berries, some spice. Some feint smoke and a hop bitterness in the finish. You get something different with each mouthful.</p>

<p>Quintine Blanche Bio Hazy golden with a fine, bubbly white head. Very apply, like apple and blackberry pie. A little tartness, some hops, and a nice clean finish with some bitterness. Slightly tingly on the tongue. Very drinkable, and something a bit different.</p>

<p>Quintine Blonde Slightly darker in colour than I was expecting from a blonde. Smells mostly of alcohol. Taste has a spicy tingle with some alcohol notes and a dryness in the finish. Not quite sure what they were aiming at.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Garrigues</p>

<p>La Belle en Goguette Pale golden with quite large bubbles of carbonation, leading to a small froth of white head. Quite a light aroma with some dry hop notes. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel, but not a huge amount going on other than some hop dryness. Nicely drinkable though.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Heineken</p>

<p>Pelforth Brune Rich brown colour with a quickly vanishing coffee-coloured head. Aroma is lightly toasted malts with some sweetness and alcohol notes. Flavour is similar to the aroma, with a mildly bitter finish. Nice thick mouthfeel, although it‚Äôs perhaps a little over-carbonated.</p>

<p>### Brasserie La Binchoise</p>

<p>Belgoo Luppo Cloudy yellow with a small tight head. Some citrus notes, smells like a typical Belgian light beer. Some floral notes and malt. Fizzy mouthfeel, quite cleansing with some citrus bitterness. A lingering, zingy aftertaste with some hoppyness.</p>

<p>Belgoo Magus Pale cloudy yellow with a smallish white head. Smells slightly tart, with a weissbier-like yeastiness. Quite fizzy, but with a well rounded taste. Some citrus hoppiness with a little apple and some lagery notes. Not what I was expecting, a bit too fizzy and sweet to be great.</p>

<p>Bi√®re Des Ours Amber, hazy, small white head with good lacing. Some bitter/sourness in the aroma, along with some floweriness. Also an unpleasant tcp smell underneath. Very thing, some dryness, smooth and bready. Couldn‚Äôt drink a lot of it.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Lefebvre</p>

<p>Barbr Cloudy golden with frothy white head. Smells of citrus and coriander. Also some sweetness (it‚Äôs a honey beer). Some initial spice overpowered by sweet honey. Some burnt sugar in the aftertaste, with definite alcohol flavours.</p>

<p>Barbr Winter Bok Black with a thin, off-white head. Aroma of dark fruits and some sweetness (it‚Äôs 2.5% honey). Lightly carbonated with a strange mouthfeel. Some fruit and honey, with a little spice and a bitter finish. A bit too thin, not really impressed.</p>

<p>Blanche de Bruxelles PCloudy pale yellow, with spots of frothy head. Smells of lemon, candy sugar and Belgian yeast. Smooth, but with a slight tingle on the tongue. Nice citrus notes. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Moeder Overste Light golden colour with fine carbonation and a largish white foamy head. Very strain, earthy aroma, with some caramel/toffee sweetness. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. A little initial sourness is followed by a strong toffee aftertaste with a little hops. Very strange balance.</p>

<p>Saison 1900 Slightly hazy, light golden with small white head. Lemon/wit-like aroma. Taste is lemony and it‚Äôs spritzy in the mouth. The aftertaste has a lot of lemon in it.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Pietra</p>

<p>Colomba Pale yellow and very cloudy. Large, fluffy white head and some sticky lacing. Smells wheaty with some citrus notes, but not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is citrus with some spice. Light and smooth, but not all that exciting.</p>

<p>Pietra Chestnut in colour with a small slightly off-white head. Smells of malt and chestnut (contains chestnut flour). Somewhat fizzy mouthfeel, with a taste dominated by malt and nuttiness. No real bitterness, but is nicely rounded with a full mouthfeel. Clean finish. The genuine nuttiness makes it interesting.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Saint-Germain</p>

<p>Page 24 A La Rhubarbe Brewed with real rhubarb juice. Clear golden with a small white froth around the edge of the glass. Light aroma of rhubarb and some alcohol notes. Tingly mouthfeel. An initial tartness leads to a drying aftertaste. Not sour, but similar in spirit to a gueuze. Quite refreshing.</p>

<p>Page 24 R√©serve Hildegarde Blonde Slightly hazy orange with plenty of carbonation and a rapidly-vanishing white head. Smells like a Belgian Blond with citrus (orange/lemon) and hops in the aroma. A lot going on; some honey sweetness, grassy hops and a rich mouthfeel continuing to a bitter hop finish. Slight cough medicine pepperiness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Saint-Monon</p>

<p>Saint Monon au Miel Small, tight white head, some lacing. Hazy, amber colour. Some honey in the aroma, possibly some Christmas spices. Quite sweet, especially in the aftertaste. Unsurprising since it contains honey.</p>

<p>### Brasserie St. Feuillien</p>

<p>St. Feuillien Blonde Golden yellow with a crisp white head. Smells sweet and floral. Very gassy with fruit and spices. A reasonably floral finish.</p>

<p>St. Feuillien Brune Chestnut brown with lots of beige foam. Smells of caramel with some dried fruits. Very sweet taste, with some tart fruitiness cutting through. Some warming alcohol with a malty, spicy finish.</p>

<p>St. Feuillien Saison Hazy orange-yellow with a white head that becomes large when agitated. Some light malt and candy sugar. Quite a lot of fizz, possibly too much. Not a huge amount of taste; some bitterness and orange in the finish. Perhaps some whisky and woody notes.</p>

<p>### Brasserie Thirez</p>

<p>Etoile Du Nord Golden orange with patchy large bubbles of head. Smells of grass with some hops and flowers. IPA-like with a crisp, dry start rounded off by a bitter-sweet finish with subtle caramel notes.</p>

<p>La Maline Black with no head and very little carbonation - looks a lot like flat coke. Not a huge amount of aroma. Sweet with toasted malt and some burnt notes. Pretty unremarkable; not bad, just a bit uninteresting.</p>

<p>### Brasserie d‚ÄôAchouffe</p>

<p>Houblon Dobbelen IPA Tripel Hazy straw with a large, frothy white head. Some streams of carbonation. Smells of citrus hops with some yeast. Bitter upfront, crisp, with a sweet malt smoothness in the middle. Finish is alcohol and tropical fruit, then dryness, which lasts for ages. A little too fizzy on the tongue, but otherwise great.</p>

<p>La Chouffe Bright golden colour with a slight haze and a large white head. Not a huge amount of aroma through the head, possibly some lemon. Slightly sweet but complicated, with a spiciness and some tartness. Not too much carbonation, very drinkable.</p>

<p>McChouffe Very dark with some ruby hints. Well carbonated. Aroma is predominantly candy sugar, with a little hops. Surprisingly light taste, some caramel and perhaps a little roasted malt, quite subtle really. Doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs 8%.</p>

<p>N‚ÄôIce Chouffe Mid-brown with tan head. Smells of light caramel and malt. Tastes similar, with good spicing; cloves, cinnamon and other mulling spices. Also distinct alcohol notes. Fairly sweet with dark fruit. Nicely complex.</p>

<p>### Brasserie d‚ÄôOrval</p>

<p>Orval Trappist Ale Deep bronze colour with a nice white head which disappears quite quickly. Smells of Belgian yeast, with spices (coriander?) and some banana. Initially tart but becoming creamy with plentiful spicing. Lasting dry finish. Complicated yet very drinkable, although perhaps in moderation.</p>

<p>### Brasserie de Rochefort</p>

<p>Rochefort 10 Dark, hazy brown with a tan head with lots of foam. Sweet smell, Belgian candy sugar with some malts. Taste starts sweet, with caramel turning into malt and a warming alcohol feel, then some spicy hops. Thick and oily and a little too alcoholic.</p>

<p>Rochefort 6 Probably the best of the Rochefort. Dark brown in colour with an almost-white foam. Aroma is biscuity malt with a little citrus, very intense. Much less sweet than the other two Rochefort, with a smoother mouthful. Mellow taste, with bread and malt with a sweetish finish.</p>

<p>Rochefort 8 Hazy dark ruby colour, with a foamy tan head and a little lacing. Smells of dried fruits and roasted malts, with some alcohol notes. Tastes similar to the smell, with some sweet caramel. Quite drinkable, but one to savour rather than quaff.</p>

<p>### Brasserie de Silly</p>

<p>Pink Killer Smells of lime, possibly washing up liquid. Cloudy, with a finger of creamy white head. Smooth, but tastes like cheap panda pop. Lemon and lime predominant. Supposed to be grapefruit. Truly awful.</p>

<p>Silly Saison Chestnut brown with a thin, slightly tan froth. Slightly cloudy. Smells of sweet malts. Some carbonation on the tongue. Taste is mostly malt and spice, with a little fruit. Not really what I expected from a saison.</p>

<p>### Brasserie de l‚ÄôAbbaye Des Rocs</p>

<p>Blanche Des Honnelles Dubbel Cloudy, yellowy orange. Bubbly, but with no head. Spicy, lemon, light bodied for what you‚Äôd expect for a ‚Äòdouble‚Äô. Hints of caramel malts, with a light bitterness. Drinkable, but a bit thin.</p>

<p>Montagnarde Ambree Cloudy dark amber with some yeast. Smells slightly astringent with some fake pineapple. Sourness and bread dominate the initial taste, with some malt and then lots of bitterness from the hops.</p>

<p>Sp√®ciale No√´l Clear mahogany with creamy head. Smells slightly tart, with dark fruit and roasted malts. Tastes similar, with some Christmas spices.</p>

<p>### Brasserie de l‚ÄôAbbaye du Val Dieu</p>

<p>Val Dieu Bi√©re De No√´l Slightly hazy golden with a bubbly, white head. Slight spice in the nose. Pretty clean-tasting with a lot of spritz in the mouth. OK, but nothing exciting (nor offensive).</p>

<p>Val Dieu Blond Hazy golden blond with a large head. Some citrus notes with a little pepper. Some banana but mostly malts with a not-too-dry finish. Like a light triple.</p>

<p>Val Dieu Brune Reddish brown with good lacing. Highly carbonated with a burnt malty flavour. Very dry finish with alcohol notes.</p>

<p>Val Dieu Grand Cru Very dark with a tan head. Smells of liquorice / dandelion and burdock. Lots going on in the mouth with a bubblegum sweetness along with alcohol and sweet, dark fruit. Very complex bu the alcohol and sweetness are overpowering; almost tastes like old-fashioned sweets. Very alcoholic.</p>

<p>Val Dieu Tripel Bright golden. Smell and taste of pepper, with some alcohol notes. Some hop bitterness. Not really something I‚Äôd describe as a triple.</p>

<p>### Brasserie de la Senne</p>

<p>Schieven IPA Dark golden with a tight white head. Some hops in the aroma and taste, but generally quite anaemic and disappointing.</p>

<p>### Brasseries Kronenbourg</p>

<p>Kronenbourg A shining example of cheap continental lager. Don‚Äôt bother.</p>

<p>Kronenbourg 1664 Golden yellow, no real head, small bubbles of carbonation. Light, quite sweet and pretty watery. Whilst it is approximately 1664 times nicer than the standard Kronenbourg, that‚Äôs not saying a lot.</p>

<p>### Braueier Grieskirchen</p>

<p>Grieskirchner Pils Light yellow with some carbonation and a white head that leaves a reasonable amount of lacing. Smells grainy, but generally mild. Not too fizzy. Malt which leads to a hoppyish finish. Pretty good beer after a day‚Äôs snowboarding.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Ayinger</p>

<p>Ayinger Jahrhundert Bier Pale golden with a small white head. Smells of sweet malt, reminiscent of a helles. Not too much fizz. Clean and very drinkable, if a little uninspiring.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Diebels</p>

<p>Diebels Alt Copper coloured with a bready-yeast aroma. Some dark fruit and sweetness in the taste with some sourness and a little astringency (tea?). Very nice.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Fruh Am Dom</p>

<p>Fr√ºh K√∂lsch Pours very pale golden with a rapidly vanishing white head. Moderate carbonation. Smells flowery with some citrus notes. Taste is light with a grape fruitiness and a little spice. Overly sweet.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Gebruder Maisel</p>

<p>Maisel‚Äôs Weisse Original Deep yellow with a couple of fingers of white head, which leads some lacing. Smells of banana and bubblegum. Taste is quite light and along the same lines as the smell. Also a little spiciness. A little thinner than I was expecting.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Goller Zur Alten Freyung</p>

<p>G√∂ller Brotzeit Seidla Very pale with a frothy white head. Smells of sweet malt. Some fizz in the mouth. Very clean with light malt and a little sweetness. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Heller</p>

<p>Hellers K√∂lsch Pale yellow with a small, rapidly-vanishing head. Light aroma with bready malt. Nothing complicated in the flavour, although there‚Äôs more going on than I expected from a K√∂lsch ‚Äì some decent hopping and grain notes. Not bad for a style I‚Äôm generally unimpressed by.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Im Fuchschen</p>

<p>Im F√ºchschen Alt Deep copper, completely clear with a dense head. Smells of sweet malts with some hops. Taste is slightly sweeter, perhaps with some nuttiness. Well hopped with a dry finish. One of the most drinkable beers I‚Äôve ever had.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Schumacher</p>

<p>Schumacher Alt Clear, orangey copper with a thick, slightly off-white head, which is long-lasting. Smell is a mix of hops and sweet, roasted malts. Taste is similar, but perhaps with a little spice. Has more body than the other alts, so less quaffable but very nice, with a little more flavour.</p>

<p>### Brauerei Weihenstephan</p>

<p>Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier Pale golden with a large white head. Banana and spice in the aroma. Taste is also banana, with some citrus. Lots of fizz on the palate, but still nicely drinkable. Actually quite filling.</p>

<p>Weihenstephaner Kristallweissbier Pale straw colour. Smells slightly lemony with yeast and some spice. Bubbly mouthfeel with plenty of malt and some crisp lemon leading to banana notes. A nice, refreshing weissbier.</p>

<p>Weihenstephaner Original Crystal clear yellow with a large, sticky head. Smells of light grain, with musty grass notes. Smooth mouthfeel with good, light hop bitterness and clean malt. Nothing different to a good helles, but then again, this is a good helles.</p>

<p>Weihenstephaner Vitus Murky, orange/yellow colour with large white head. Smells slightly lemony with yeast and some spice. Tastes slightly musty/hayey with some banana and caramel. Well carbonated. Very nice example of a Weisenbock.</p>

<p>### Braydons</p>

<p>Yer Tiz Supposedly triple hopped. Tastes dirty and not hoppy at all. Very odd.</p>

<p>### Breconshire Brewery</p>

<p>Ysbrid y Ddraig Deep golden in colour. Matured in whisky casks, which you can certainly taste and smell. Similar to Innis and Gunn but with more hops.</p>

      <td>03 Pale golden with no real head. Does indeed smell of elderflower and lime. Quite fizzy. Definite elderflower and lime in the taste as well. Slightly spicy finish. Wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs a beer.</td>

<p>### Brew Moon</p>

<p>Luna Wit Hazy golden with patchy white head.  Smells of lemon and spices. Tastes like a wit with yeast and citrus. Nicely balanced. Very clean and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Brew York</p>

<p>X-Panda V1 Officially a session IPA. Clear orange with a good head. Aroma of malt with some sweetness and obvious hop notes. Flavour is medium in pretty much everything.</p>

<p>### BrewDog</p>

<p>0.5% Coffee Stout Low alcohol. Jet black with a tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and definite coffee. Taste is rich coffee with a decent amount of fizz. It‚Äôs a bit thin and really just coffee, but I could drink this all day.</p>

<p>5am Saint Dark amber/chestnut with patches of bubbly white head. Some resin hop aroma. Tastes slightly burnt, very savoury with soy sauce like notes. Some dryness in the finish, but overall it‚Äôs just odd.</p>

<p>77 Lager Smells a little lagery, but with more malt than you‚Äôd expect. Slightly sour with a hoppy bitterness. Quite like a light IPA.</p>

<p>Alice Porter Ruby red, smells slightly fruity. Taste dark and fruity with some burnt notes. OK, but not as smooth as some porters, and not really interesting enough for the ABV.</p>

<p>Alice Porter (5.2%) Pours black with a small tan head. Smells of roast, dark malt. Smooth mouthfeel with little carbonation. Dominated by red fruit, sweetness and a slightly bitter, lingering finish. OK, but a bit middle of the road.</p>

<p>Avery Brown Dredge Dark golden with a very small white head. Light malt with some hops, but less than I was expecting. Lots of alcohol notes as well. Massive amounts of taste, mostly bitter hops, grapefruit and a little sweetness. Also some skunk notes, with biscuity malt - it‚Äôs got almost everything you could ask for in a light beer. Finish is dry with a smooth hop bitterness with resin notes and a small amount of interesting. Very good, but perhaps there‚Äôs too much going on.</p>

<p>Bitch Please Dark brown with red hints and very little head. Smells strong with roasted and smoked notes. Pretty smokey taste. Quite like Tactical Nuclear Penguin watered down to a slightly more sensible ABV.</p>

<p>Bounty Hunter Very dark brown with a beige head. Aroma of chocolate and coconut. Very drinkable, quite rich with more chocolate and coconut. Not too much carbonation. Bittersweet finish.</p>

<p>Brixton Porter Jet black with tan head that leaves good lacing. Some dark fruit along with rich malt in the aroma. Taste is well rounded with chocolate, coffee and some fruit bitterness. Nice lingering bitter finish. A very nice porter.</p>

<p>Campfire Cult A bit of a weird one - a sour stout. Black with virtually no head. Smell is a mix of roasted stout aromas and sourness. Bitterness first, leads into roasted notes and a slightly weird finish. Interesting to try.</p>

<p>Choco Libre Jet black with small ring of tan head. Loads of coffee, chocolate and dark, roasted malt in the aroma. Very full mouthfeel with a good bitterness and plenty of roasted flavours. A very nice Imperial stout.</p>

<p>Cocoa Psycho Very dark with a tan head. Smells lightly of cocoa. Rich and smooth with chocolate notes and some bitterness. Nice, lingering bitter finish. Very nice, but definitely a sipping winter beer.</p>

<p>Cult Lager Very drinkable lager, similar in style to good German Helles. Strong kick of hops may not appeal to fans of generic UK lagers.</p>

<p>Dead Pony Club Pale golden. Smells strongly of American hops with a good mix of resin, fruit and dryness. Taste is an explosion of hops, well-balanced and not too harsh or bitter. Clean start, leading to a hoppy finish. Good American-style pale ale.</p>

<p>Dogma Very dark brown with no head. Apparently contains heather and honey. Some dark, sweet spiciness in the nose. Slight tingle, with spice and dry bitterness with sour notes in the finish.</p>

<p>East of Vermont Yellow with very small head. Looks quite a lot like mango juice. Definite soft fruit (peach and mango) in the aroma. Some follows through into the taste, along with plenty of hop bitterness and resin notes.</p>

<p>Electric India Clear golden with quickly-vanishing white head. Orange and spice in the aroma. Loads of flavour with citrus hops and some spice. Also a sweetness leading to a peppery and bitter finish. Very interesting.</p>

<p>Elvis Juice Reddish orange brown with bubbly white head. Smells of resinous hops. Definite grapefruit notes at the start leading  to a slightly bitter finish with fruit sweetness. Very good.</p>

<p>Fake Lager Pale golden with small white head. Smells and tastes lagery, bit more in the good German style.</p>

<p>Fake Lager with nectarines Golden with small white head. Odd mix of grain and fruitiness in the aroma. Definite nectarine in the flavour. Dominates the beer flavour. Nice. Perhaps a bit too fruity.</p>

<p>Hardcore IPA Light, golden colour, with a strong aroma of alcohol and fruit. Reminds me of a barley wine. Tastes almost entirely of alcohol, followed by a dry, lingering, unpleasant aftertaste. Not a patch on their Punk IPA.</p>

<p>Hazy AF Hazy golden with floral hops and tropical fruit in the aroma. Light and refreshing with a medium carbonation. Taste is citrus and tropical fruits. A very decent low alcohol beer.</p>

<p>Hazy Jane Hazy golden, as the name would suggest. Aroma has lots of tropical fruit good. Thin white head rapidly vanishes. Taste has some malt, but dominated by citrus (grapefruit) and US-style hops. Very drinkable, worryingly so given the ABV.</p>

<p>Hella Helles Golden with tight, almost creamy, white head. Grass and grain notes that you‚Äôd expect from a Helles. Taste is also as you‚Äôd expect, with some sweet malt and a light bitterness in the finish. Certainly competes with a standard German Helles.</p>

<p>Hoppy Christmas It‚Äôs a strong, highly-hopped American-style IPA. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, but it‚Äôs not amazing either.</p>

<p>IPA is Dead - Exp 366 Golden with very little head. Single hop IPA. Resin hop aroma. Taste has resin, pine and grapefruit with a very lingering bitterness. Some tropical fruit? Very drinkable and interesting.</p>

<p>IPA is dead amarillo Golden with small white head. Some hop aroma. Clean and worryingly drinkable, although nothing to write home about.</p>

<p>Indie Pale Ale Not a huge amount of aroma. Maybe some citrus. Not a lot going on in the taste department either.</p>

<p>Instamatic A white IPA, whatever that means. Hazy golden with a large white head that fades to bubbles. Not a huge amount of aroma, maybe some lemon notes. Taste is quite thin. Some bitterness, with a smooth mouthfeel. Clean and refreshing, but unexciting.</p>

<p>International Arms Race Dark golden with a small white head that gives good lacing when swirled. Smells of ginger and sweetness. Doesn‚Äôt taste anywhere near as sweet as it smells. Light spicing with ginger and some orange bitterness in the finish. Taste is much better than the aroma. A nice take on a hop-free beer.</p>

<p>Jack Hammer Pale golden with no head. Loads of resinous and bitter hops in the aroma. Quite tingly. Definitely dominated by hops, especially resin and bitterness. Pretty good, and very unsubtle.</p>

<p>Jet Black Heart Smells like a slightly sweet stout. Pretty rich with not a lot of fizz, some roasted malt, sweetness and light chocolate notes. Also a touch of bitterness. It‚Äôs basically what you‚Äôd expect from a milk stout.</p>

<p>Libertine Black Ale Very dark with a small white head. Aroma has alcohol, cherry, some resin/dry hops and grapefruit pith. Tastes like a black IPA with hop notes, resin, roasted malt and a touch of disappointment.</p>

<p>Magic Stone Dog Brewed with Stone and Magic Rock. Pale golden with very little head. Clean and crisp with a bitter spicy hop finish.</p>

<p>Mistletoe Mafia Apparently a festive Vienna lager. Clear dark golden with frothy white head. Aroma and taste are dominated by sweet malt. Quite a lot of biscuit flavour and not a lot else.</p>

<p>Nanny State Brewed in response to media criticism of BrewDog‚Äôs recent high percentage beers. Smells of raw hops, with an initial hop blast, folowed by a long malt-heavy, somewhat sweet finish. Surprisingly dark, with a good head. Develops an increasingly hoppy aftertaste. Other than tasting slightly unfinished, you‚Äôd never know this was so weak.</p>

<p>Native Son Double IPA. Slightly hazy dark golden/orange, with small white head. Some hops in the aroma, but not as much as I expected. Same in the taste, although there is a long, bitter finish.</p>

<p>Paradox Longrow Smells of whisky and roasted malts with a sweetness akin to other stouts. Pours very black with a thin white head. Tastes of malts with some chocolate and a slight sweetness. Some slight whisky notes, but not overpowering. Nice warming alcohol.</p>

<p>Punk AF Pale yellow gold with small, bubbly white head and streams of large bubbles. Tropical fruit aroma. Very clean and light with some sharpness in the finish and quite a spritzy mouthfeel. Very nice alcohol free beer.</p>

<p>Punk IPA Smells strongly of hops, also slightly floral. Very hoppy, slightly resinous taste. Aftertaste is long-lasting, with dry hops, but also refreshing. The taste develops through the bottle, becoming more complex. Worryingly drinkable, especially considering the percentage.</p>

<p>Quench Quake Clear golden with no real head. As expected, the aroma is fruity and sour. Taste has plenty of citrus, with tangerine/orange and maybe grapefruit. It‚Äôs essentially alcoholic fruit juice, and none the worse for it. Fun and interesting.</p>

<p>Raspberry Blitz Low alcohol. Pink with a white foam. Taste and aroma are both tart raspberry with some sweetness. Very drinkable and balanced. Perhaps a little thin, but otherwise very nice.</p>

<p>Slot Machine Red rye IPA. Dark red with frothy and sticky off-white head. Aroma has citrus and some sweetness, as well as rye notes. Plenty of hops with dry, resin dominating. Finish is quite spicy with a lingering, dry bitterness.</p>

<p>Strawberry Blitz Very cloudy as pink - looks like pink grapefruit juice. Definite aroma of strawberries. Taste is initially a little strawberry with a sourness in the finish, but not too harsh. Berliner Weiss style.</p>

<p>Tactical Nuclear Penguin [Shared, poured into small glasses ‚Äì yes, it really is 32%] Very dark, no head or carbonation, Smells of stout, smoke and alcohol. Tastes very similar to a smokey whisky, with a little sweetness. Some peat and slightly burnt notes. Complicated, and definitely not a quaffing beer. Would be a pretty decent whisky.</p>

<p>Vagabond Gluten free! Load‚Äôs loads tropical fruit fruit hops. Tastes of passion fruit and pineapple. Good hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Zombie Cake Dark with definite red hints and a lacy off-white head. Sweet and roasted aroma. Quite a full mouthfeel with sweetness and some vanilla and chocolate notes. Smooth and very drinkable.</p>

<p>### BrewDog (Tesco)</p>

<p>American Double IPA Copper in colour, smells very hoppy (as it should). Very tingly hops, some grassiness and definite alcohol notes. Hops are flowery and fruity with some spice notes. Very drinkable, worryingly so given the ABV.</p>

<p>### Brewers &amp; Union</p>

<p>Beast of the Deep Hazy golden amber with a white head. Smells quite sweet with caramel notes. An OK beer, with some syrupy notes; could do with some more bitterness to combat the sweetness and alcohol.</p>

<p>### Brewery Budweiser Budvar</p>

<p>Budvar Dark Lager Dark brown, almost black with a small off-white head. Smells of roasted malts, much like a dark mild. Nicely rounded and crisp, mostly malt with some faint hops and a little sweetness. More like a mild than a standard dark lager, i.e. heavier and fuller.</p>

<p>### Brewsters</p>

<p>Stilton Porter Dark brown with a small, off-white head. Smells of roasted malt and dark fruits. Flavour is similar, no detectable stilton, but it‚Äôs a very nice stout.</p>

<p>### Bristol Beer Factory</p>

<p>Acer Pale golden with bubbly white head. Citrus hop aroma. Loads of hops in the taste with citrus and bitterness. Excellent session beer.</p>

<p>Blackcurrant and Licquourice Dark with a tan head. Don‚Äôt get either of the flavours in the aroma. Maybe a touch of fruit in the taste, along with some sourness in the finish. A bit disappointing.</p>

<p>Bristol Hefe Hazy orange with frothy head. Smells of yeast, with a bubblegum sweetness along with pineapple and mango. Tastes quite sweet with banana and yeast. Leads to a bitter, dry and fruity finish. Not as good as many German weisses.</p>

<p>Bristol Stout Slight red tinge with very little head. Some roasted malts in the aroma. Quite light and fizzy with some dry roasted notes which linger well.</p>

<p>Chilli Chocolate Stout Smells more chocolatey than the standard chocolate stout, but there‚Äôs no chilli that I can find at all. There‚Äôs some tingle, but that could just be the fizz. Again, bitter in the finish. Not bad, but disappointing.</p>

<p>Chocolate Orange Stout Smells of bitter orange. Tastes like orange chocolate, but more the former than the latter. Again, quite a thin stout with a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>Chocolate Stout Smells slightly sweet. Tastes a bit chocolatey, but more like cocoa powder than proper chocolate. Really all the chocolate does is add a bitterness to it.</p>

<p>Creme Brulee Aged in rum casks. Dark with a tan head. Definite alcohol notes in the aroma. Mostly rum in the mouth, with no real vanilla or sweetness. Not really what it says on the bottle, but a nice rum cask stout.</p>

<p>Exhibition Very dark brown, almost black with no head. Smells of dark fruit. Not too fizzy in the mouth, with some roasted malt and cocoa notes. Could do being a bit more exciting to justify the ABV.</p>

<p>Fortitude Copper with tight, frothy white head. It‚Äôs a generic bitter with some slightly sweet malt and light fruity notes and bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Glenlivet Cask Stout Looks similar to the Laphroaig stout. Tastes a lot like Glenlivet. Again, a very nice beer, but not as nice a whisky cask. Much lighter and appealed to a wider range of people. Develops an almost sweet flavour.</p>

<p>Gold Golden with a large, frothy white head. Aroma is citrus hops with a little malt. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel with a weird astringent dryness. On the plus side, this makes it quite refreshing. Not bad overall.</p>

<p>Hazelnut Latte Stout Smells of roast coffee. Tastes like watery coffee with a strange bitterness in the finish. Also some sweetness in the aftertaste with a slight stickiness. Reminds me of tia maria.</p>

<p>Imperial Bourbon Dark with a dark brown head. Smells slightly bourbony. Very smooth with definite bourbon notes in the finish. Perhaps a bit rich, but a nice sharing beer.</p>

<p>Imperial Stout Jet black with a slightly oily look to the surface. Smells of roasted may. Very smooth with alcohol notes and a lovely, full, rounded mouthfeel. Nicely complex with some dark fruit and brandy/port-like alcohol.</p>

<p>Imperial Whisky Dark with a dark brown head. Definite Speyside notes in the aroma. Very nice; must be done with a good Speyside. Tastes exactly how you‚Äôd expect. Maybe not quite as nice as the Laphroag cask though.</p>

<p>Independence Golden with frothy white head. Loads of hop aroma, mostly tropical fruit. Taste is similar with loads of dry, fruity, tropical hops. Packs a real punch. Excellent beer.</p>

<p>Laphroaig Cask Stout Definite whisky aroma with some smokiness. No real head. Tastes like Laphroaig with plenty of peaty smoke. Bang on. Like a less alcoholic (and nicer) version of Tactical Nuclear Penguin. Very nice.</p>

<p>Milk Stout Smells slightly sweet, but not a lot else going on. Also quite fizzy with with an additional creaminess leading to a smooth finish.</p>

<p>Mocha Dark with a tan head. Unsurprisingly smells of mocha with lots of coffee (like coffee cream sweets). Coffee at the start of the taste, leading to chocolate and then back into a coffee aftertaste.</p>

<p>Number 7 Pale copper and smells more roasted than you‚Äôd expect from the colour. Long, lingering dryness with a bit of malt and some greenness.</p>

<p>Port Dark with a tan head. Some port aroma. Also port notes in the aftertaste, which overpowers any sweet or roasted notes there may have been in the original stout.</p>

<p>Raspberry Stout Smells of raspberry but in a synthetic way. Initial taste is in fact raspberry with good sourness, but then leads to a syrupy sweetness reminiscent of cough medicine.</p>

<p>Smoked Chilli and Chipotle Dark with a tan head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some pepperiness and a hint of building chilli heat in the finish. Would definitely be worth trying a whole pint.</p>

<p>Southville Hop Very hazy, dark golden in colour with a small lacy white head. Smells strongly of tropical fruits, mango and passionfruit. Surprisingly clean-tasting, some fizz with a bit of sherbet and plenty of fruity hops.</p>

<p>Ultimate Raspberry Dark with not a lot of head. Some berry notes in the aroma. Definite raspberry in the taste. Genuinely like a mix of stout and raspberry beer, which may or may not appeal.</p>

<p>Ultimate Stout Not a lot of aroma, but a much fuller mouthfeel than the previous stouts. Some fizz and definite alcohol notes coming through. Has a lingering warmth and a slight dryness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>Vanilla Milk Stout Smells very similar to the normal milk stout. However, there‚Äôs lots of vanilla and cream in the taste. Vanilla is overpowering, but some people really liked it. Tastes like a vanilla stout float.</p>

<p>West Coast Red Reddish brown with a very small off-white head. Smells of floral, resinous and bitter hops. Tastes similar. Well-rounded with roasted notes in the finish and some sweetness. Aftertaste is somewhat overpowering.</p>

<p>### Brodies</p>

<p>Smoked Rye Porter Dark black with a very small, off-white head. Light roasted coffee notes. Some creamy/milk aromas as well. Quite tingly in the mouth. Light, roasted malt and some hoppiness. A bit dull, but very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Brooklyn Brewery</p>

<p>Black Chocolate Stout Opaque black colour, with a quickly-vanishing head. Some chocolate and coffee aroma and some alcohol notes. Very roasted taste, if there‚Äôs any chocolate taste it‚Äôs bitter dark chocolate. Slightly bitter with some alcohol.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Brown Ale Dark brown, with a good head, which disappears quickly. Smells strongly of malt, and is a little fizzy on the tongue. Initially tastes ‚Äòdark‚Äô, roasted malts with chocolate/coffee undertones. No real lingering aftertaste.</p>

<p>Brooklyn Lager Amber coloured, although I drank the second one out the bottle. A very well-balanced lager with enough hops and malt; the floral hops keep it refreshing and interesting. Not too fizzy.</p>

<p>East India Pale Ale Variable head (at the beer tasting), with medium carbonation. Copper coloured with little aroma. Quite dry and hoppy, as you‚Äôd expect from an IPA. Unpleasant dry, almost astringent aftertaste.</p>

<p>Insulated Guessing that this is a take on a German Dunkel (I drank it with a German, anyway). Very dark with tight and large off-white head. Roasted and almost nutty aroma. Taste is light and drinkable, whilst still being complex enough to keep it interesting. Would like to try again.</p>

<p>Local 1 pale golden with some streams of carbonation. Small finger of white head. Hops and soft fruit (banana/pineapple) in the smell, along with some candy sugar. Quite fizzy mouthfeel, with alcoholic notes, some pepper and a slightly metallic taste. Dry finish, but a bit sticky.</p>

<p>Local 2 Darkish brown with a tan head. Bittersweet aroma. Some malt and roasted notes. Pretty standard, and not really worth the ABV.</p>

<p>Scorcher IPA Golden with small white froth. Lemon/citrus aroma. Taste is grapefruit/lemon bitterness with quite a sweet finish. More of a pale ale than an IPA. Generic but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>### Broughton</p>

<p>6.2 IPA Does what it says on the bottle. It‚Äôs a strong and hoppy IPA. Chestnut brown with citrus aroma. Lots of hops with dry, resinous notes mixed with fruitiness. Quite complex.</p>

<p>Blonde Lots of citrus (lemon) aroma. Clean and crisp. It‚Äôs a very drinkable and somewhat interesting lager. Also has some sweet caramel notes.</p>

<p>Greenmantle Ale Dark mahogany with a tight, very slightly off-white head. Smells sweet with caramel and roasted nuts. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel, and also quite thin. Some bitterness, but not a lot else. Nothing wrong with it though.</p>

<p>Hopopotamus Loads of dry hop aroma with fruitiness. Certainly doesn‚Äôt hold back. Dry and bitter with a big punch of hops. Fruity notes develop and then a lingering, dry finish. One for the hop lovers.</p>

<p>Merlin‚Äôs Ale Golden with tight white head. Some hops in the aroma and taste. Generally very drinkable but nothing special.</p>

<p>Proper IPA Deep gold with loads of citrus in the aroma. Quite fizzy with plenty of citrus and sharp hops dominating the taste. Lingering, quite bitter finish. Not subtle, but very nice.</p>

<p>Sin Bin Ale Dark golden with rocky white head. Smells a bit sour. Lots of bitterness with occasional fruit notes. Distinctly average.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij  De Bie</p>

<p>Stoute Bie Very large tan head on a dark brown beer. Smells bitter and slightly spicy. Sweet malt with some bitterness. Slightly odd but quite nice.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Bavik</p>

<p>Petrus Aged Pale Clear golden. Smells surprisingly sour. Taste is similar, like a light Flanders red or gueuze. Dry finish. Definitely one to be savoured rather than quaffed.</p>

<p>Pilaarbijter Bruin Dark brown with tan head. Smells sweet, a bit like coke. Very well rounded and drinkable, with some roasted sweetness. Clean and somewhat refreshing.</p>

<p>Pilaarbijter Tripel Blonde Clear golden. Tight bubbles of white head that calm down after a while. Grain aroma, almost sour notes. Sweet, fizzy and metallic with an odd aftertaste, especially on the roof of the mouth. Has the feeling of bad real cider.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Bocker</p>

<p>Bellegems Bruin Reddish-brown with a small, off-white head. Smells sour. Tastes similar, although perhaps it‚Äôs a bit out of balance even for something trying to be sour. A blend of Flanders Ould Bruin and an 18 month old lambic.</p>

<p>Bellegems Witbier Hazy yellow with a small, white head. Smells like a lemony witbier. Smooth with a slight tingle in the mouth. Quite full wheat mouthfeel, cut through by lemon citrus. Very drinkable with a nice, lingering finish.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Boon</p>

<p>Boon Oude Geuze Clear golden with a thick head. Carbonated like Champagne. Smell is mostly floral, with some apple. Moderately sour tat, with a little spice. Nicely balanced, not too tart. Quite fizzy on the tongue. Very complex and moreish.</p>

<p>Horals Oude Gueuze Mega Blend Slightly hazy golden in colour, with a tight white head. Smells like you‚Äôd expect from a gueuze, with lemon, light vinegar and some mild funk notes. Taste is similar, and this gueuze isn‚Äôt too sour, well balanced but not a huge amount of complexity. Tea notes keep it interesting. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Bosteels</p>

<p>Bosteel Dubbel Mahogany with tight bubbles of white head. Sugar, alcohol and orange notes in the aroma. Lots of fizz in the mouth, but quite clean with spice and alcohol. Also some dark sugar. Lingering, spicy finish.</p>

<p>Deus Golden, small bubbles of carbonation with a relatively large head of tiny white bubbles. Some alcohol notes with floweriness in the aroma. Clean initial taste with a definite tingle on the tongue. Hops and a little sweetness with an alcohol undertone. Almost wine-like at times. Very nice, but also very expensive.</p>

<p>Pauwel Kwak Cloudy orange with a decent head. Some cirrus aroma. Quite gassy, with a malt taste and a slightly sour finish. Slightly too sweet but there is at least a balancing dryness.</p>

<p>Tripel Karmeliet Slightly hazy pale amber, thin white lacing. Honey and malt in the aroma. Mouthfeel is prickly. Some fruit and a mild spiciness, some malts. Alcohol gets more noticeable towards the end. Could do with a litte more taste to balance the ABV, but very nice.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Corsendonk</p>

<p>Corsendonk Agnus Light golden, slightly hazy. Citrus with maybe apple in the aroma. Tastes very crisp with some dryness and hop bitterness. Does also have a hint of sweetness. Very drinkable, if slightly tame for a triple.</p>

<p>Corsendonk Christmas Reddish-brown with large foamy white head. Smells strong. Some alcohol burn and sweet malts in the flavour. Other than that, it‚Äôs very bland with a massive sweet hit in the finish, along with more alcohol.</p>

<p>Corsendonk Dubbel Dark with red hues and a very tight slightly off-white head. Toasted, slightly burt aroma with some dark fruit. Fizzes to extra head in the mouth. Quite rich with dark fruit and alcohol dominating.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Bie</p>

<p>Helleketelbier Hazy golden with a fine white head. Slight sour notes with some fruit and sweetness. Also an odd dirty-dishwater overtone. Taste is caramelized sugar and dirtyiness. Lots of alcohol and some sweet fruit. A weird sourness means it‚Äôs a bit bland but remarkably offensive at the same time.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Block</p>

<p>Satan Gold Clear golden, a few streams of bubbles. Bottle conditioned. Creamy, white head. Aroma is reminiscent of champagne. Very fizzy. Taste is biscuity malt, with some fruit in the finish. Nice, dry, slightly chalky finish. The bottom of the bottle is slightly sweeter and fuller in flavour. Everyone liked this.</p>

<p>Satan Red Slightly hazy golden beer with a small white head. Smells of bitter hops with some dryness and perhaps a little fruit. Some carbonation in the mouth. Sweet malts and a strange lingering finish. A little spice and burnt sugar turning to slightly-too-strong alcohol.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Dochter van de Korenaar</p>

<p>Bravoure Dark golden with some spice and light smoke aroma. Taste is similar but the smoke dominates. Much like drinking a campfire, and not bad for it.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Dolle Brouwers</p>

<p>Dulle Teve Tight, small white head, which is quite bubbly. Copper, hazy with a little carbonation. Smells sweet and strong. Big alcohol kick in the taste, sweet with a long alcohol burn. Perhaps some sour fruit, with some dryness in the aftertaste. Much too strong.</p>

<p>Oerbier Reddy brown with a tan head. Caramel, malt and dark fruit. Maybe a little sweetness. Taste is very strong alcohol, which almost reaches a burn. A large amount of fizz ans some sourness, like a very alcoholic Flemish bruin. Also some burnt malt notes after a while.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Graal</p>

<p>Hopjutter Tripel Hop Hazy golden with a very large white head. Nice mixed hop aroma with citrus fruit and a little bitterness. Taste is clean, with a good balance of hops. Pretty good.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Keersmaeker</p>

<p>Mort Subite Gueuze White frothy head, easy going for a gueuze, with some sourness, but not overpowering. It‚Äôs refreshing, but a bit dull, I‚Äôd like more of a tang.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Koninck</p>

<p>De Koninck Light ruby-amber with a little carbonation and good head retention. Smells quite fruity with some spicy hops. Tastes a bit grassy with some grain notes, leading to spicy hops and a little bitterness. Finish is quite dry.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Landtsheer</p>

<p>Malheur 10¬∞ Cloudy yellow with a couple of fingers of white head. Smells sweet, with citrus and alcohol cutting through. Tastes sweet and alcoholic, maybe some fruit but it‚Äôs hard to pick out. Full mouthed. It‚Äôs quite drinkable, take it slow though.</p>

<p>Malheur 12¬∞ Dark brown, almost black with a frothy head. Smells strongly of roasted malts, quite bitter with an alcohol undertone. Definitely a potent beer. Much more roasted than most quadruples, and very easy to drink given the ABV.</p>

<p>Malheur 6¬∞ Golden, slightly hazy with a tight white head. A few bubbles of carbonation. Smells weissbier-like with citrus and some spices. Also some soap notes. Quite gassy and doesn‚Äôt taste of a whole lot. Some breadiness and an alcohol twang. Really not very exciting and the tinglyness overpowers any taste there is.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Musketiers</p>

<p>Troubadour Magma Light copper colour, with a tight white head. Smells strong, with Belgian sugar and yeast. Clearly bottle conditioned. Quite sweet with brown sugar and alcohol burn throughout. Some mead notes.</p>

<p>Troubadour Obscura Black, smells strong and dark, dominated by heavily-roasted malts, which linger, and an alcohol hit, that doesn‚Äôt.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Ranke</p>

<p>Hop Harvest 2012 Hazy, light golden with large, tight bubbles of white head. Smells quite like a wit with some soapiness. Very smooth with bitterness in the finish. A good wit-like beer but not exciting enough to rave about, especially as it‚Äôs a bit soapy.</p>

<p>Noir de Dottignies Very dark with a tan head. Some roasted malts in the aroma, with dark fruit (raisins), coffee ground and hop bitterness. Smells quite strong. Tingly mouthfeel, gassy like an imperial stout. Very nice, with plenty of malt (apparently 6 types) balanced by hop dryness and a little fruit.</p>

<p>P√®re No√´l Pours slightly hazy orange, with a fluffy head. Smells of hops and perhaps some spice. Taste is quite hop-bitter, with some fruitiness and a bit of malt coming through. Very well balanced. A bit like Duvel with added hops.</p>

<p>XX Bitter Pale yellow with a frothy white head and good lacing. Streams of carbonation. Aroma has some candy sugar and Belgian yeast, along with citrus hops. Some citrus and lingering bitterness in the taste. Nicely refreshing with a little astringency.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij De Ryck</p>

<p>Arend Tripel Cloudy golden beer with a huge head, but could well have been the pouring (beer tasting). Smells slightly sweet, although hard to get anything past the head. Heavy lacing. Strong alcohol aftertaste. Very light, a bit creamy. Not a huge amount of taste but some lingering bitterness.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Deca Services</p>

<p>Antiek Blond Cloudy dark yellow. Small finger of white head which is quite creamy. Some lacing. Not a huge amount of aroma, some candy sugar and alcohol notes. Sticky and slightly cloying.</p>

<p>Westoek XX Copper with a fine white head. Sour, malty, and fruity. Quite fizzy with plenty of flavour, similar to the aroma. Complex yet worryingly drinkable. Some sourness in the start, which fades, and then returns in the finish.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Drie Fonteinen</p>

<p>Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze Hazy golden with a small haze of white head. Smells of musty yeast with some sour notes. Not too sour, reminiscent of champagne, with a little carbonation and a crisp finish. A good gueuze, and subtle enough to be an excellent introduction to the style.</p>

<p>Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze Vintage 2007 Hazy golden with a small haze of white head. Smells of musty yeast with some sour notes. Fizzy mouthfeel, very drying, but nice and clean with some slight mustiness in the finish. Surprisingly subtle and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat</p>

<p>Duvel Large, rocky white head on a clear, very pale golden beer. Good lacing. Smells of alcohol and a little yeast. Taste is very clean, with pale malt, then yeast, hop bitterness and some alcohol. Nice, cleansing finish. It‚Äôs almost like a dry champagne, with a nice balance between the alcohol and crisp bitterness.</p>

<p>Duvel Green Clear golden, with a good frothy white head. Smells slightly of candy sugar, but it‚Äôs a bit hard to get much through the head. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel, with some malt followed by a lingering hop dryness. A bit ‚ÄúDuvel-lite‚Äù.</p>

<p>Duvel Tripel Hop 2010 Cloudy golden, with a frothy white head. Candy sugar, lemon, some hops - both citrus and bitter in the aroma. Fizzy mouthfeel, with lots of hop dryness. Has an almost floury mouthfeel from the dry hops, but is very drinkable and very, very nice. Plus it comes in big bottles!</p>

<p>Duvel Tripel Hop 2012 (Citra) Slightly hazy, light golden with a large frothy white head that leaves good lacing. Smells astringent with hop and spice aromas. Massive frothy head when swirled. Definitely tastes like it‚Äôs a high ABV beer, with lemon and a bit of alcohol burn. Interesting, but a bit too strong for the level of hopping.</p>

<p>Maredsous 10 Very foamy, a hazy golden yellow. Smells dry with some citrus notes. Quite bitter with alcohol warmth. Some spices, but not very well balanced.</p>

<p>Maredsous 6 Cloudy yellow, well carbonated with a creamy white head. Some citrus and spice in the aroma. Tastes of the same, with a little sweetness. Lively and fresh, but not overly interesting.</p>

<p>Maredsous 8 Reddish brown with a creamy light tan head. Smells slightly sweet with some dark fruits. Surprisingly crisp with some spice and alcohol. Dry malt leading to bitter hops and fruit. Very drinkable, and not overpowering for the ABV.</p>

<p>Vedett Nicer than the bottled version; tastes similar but less fizzy and more drinkable.</p>

<p>Vedett Straw coloured, quite fizzy with little head. Smells of generic lager, with a little hop. Tastes like a pils, but there‚Äôs not much there. Too fizzy.</p>

<p>Vedett Extra White Cloudy, light yellow with a thick white head. Smells fruity, with lemon and maybe some banned. Also a little spice. Taste is very citric, with lemon and then a little spice. Pretty highly carbonated, but doesn‚Äôt affect the drinkability. Nice refreshing beer.</p>

<p>Vedett IPA Golden with no head. Lots of hops in the aroma, along with some alcohol. Quite fizzy. Much less hop Taste than expected. Mostly sweet and spicy malt.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Fisser</p>

<p>Ne Fliererfluiter Slightly hazy golden with tight white head. Alcohol notes with some sweetness. Fizzy and tastes strong with some caramel sweetness in the finish. I thought it was a Belgian strong pale ale. A bit too high an ABV for what it does, and a bit too astringent in the finish.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Girardin</p>

<p>Girardin Gueuze 1882 Light amber with fine bubbles of carbonation which give a small, white head. Smells very sour with some yeast notes and a lingering dryness. Taste is very tart, but in no way unpleasant. Some grapefruit and gooseberry dryness. A top class gueuze.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Haacht</p>

<p>Charles Quint/Keizer Karel Dark copper with slightly off-white bubbles of head.  Smells quite sweet with fruitiness. Interesting but a bit weird.</p>

<p>Ommegang Charles Quint Very clear with lots of fizz and large bubbles of white head. Some lemony citrus aroma with yeast and a little clove-like spice. Tastes stronger the more you drink. A bit too sweet, fizzy and lagery.</p>

<p>Tongerlo 8 Tripel Blond Amber coloured, with a slight hoppy aroma. Again, slightly hoppy taste, combined with a reasonable amount of citrus and spice (from the hops). Fills the mouth well, and has a nice warmth from the alcohol. A little malt, with sark fruits.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Het Anker</p>

<p>Boscoulis Red with a small white head with little lacing. Smells of raspberry and strawberry. Some sour noted balanced by a little candy sugar. Tastes like ribena or `something and black‚Äô. Quite thin but tastes like it‚Äôs seen real fruit. A fruit wit, which is a bit of a change to the standard fruit beers.</p>

<p>Gouden Carolus Ambrio Reddy brown, no fizz. Slightly off-white tight, large head. Smells of malt, some alcohol notes and yeast. Fizzy mouthfeel, slightly chewy palate with lots of sweet malt. RIch and smooth, slightly roasted finish.</p>

<p>Gouden Carolus Classic Reasonably dark with little carbonation. Thin head. Smells slightly of burnt sugar and some dandelion and burdock. Quite strong tasting with some dark fruit and burnt sugar. Slightly tangy aftertaste.</p>

<p>Gouden Carolus Hopsinjoor Pale golden, cloudy with a massive rocky/frothy white head. Exploded out of the bottle, Smells of hops, with citrus and spice. Fizzy mouthfeel. Lots of hop flavour with spicy pepperiness and a lingering alcohol warmth. Very nice, just a little too fizzy.</p>

<p>Gouden Carolus Tripel Pale straw in colour with a slight fizz. Good frothy head with little lacing. Smells of Belgian candy sugar, maybe some citrus. Fizzy mouthfeel with citrus, but like washing up liquid. Some apple and pineapple in the long aftertaste.</p>

<p>Maneblusser Pale yellow-golden with a thin, white head. Smells citrusy with some light malt. Smooth and clean with citrus hop bitterness and a slight spice tingle/ Very drinkable with a cleansing, slightly bitter aftertaste with a little sweetness.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Hof Ten Dormaal</p>

<p>Wit Goud Name means white gold. Slightly hazy golden with a finger of white, bubbly head, so that‚Äôs a good start. Smells strong with candy sugar and spice. Very, very fizzy, which masks most of the flavour, if there is any. Some sweetness comes through, but just far too fizzy.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Huyghe</p>

<p>Delirium Nocturnum Dark ruby with a tan head. Smells almost medicinal, with some caramel and alcohol. Surprisingly creamy with malts and some caramel. Has a little spice with some warming alcohol notes. Quite complex, with a drying aftertaste.</p>

<p>Delirium Red Red/purple brown with a small slick of white head. Definite cherry aroma. Dry and slightly sour with a drying finish and some chalkiness. Taste is cough drop cherry. Sweetness builds slowly but overpowered by a bitter finish reminiscent of cherry stones.</p>

<p>Delirium Tremens Yellow, with a large foamy white head. Smells spicy with some apricot or other soft fruit. Medium bodied, with pale malts and fruitiness. Some honey sweetness accompanies the alcohol. However, this is really all about the spices. This could get you very drunk, very quickly.</p>

<p>Huyghe Tripel Clear golden with a white head that leaves good lacing. Smells of alcohol, yeast and some spicing. Very smooth in the mouth, although it‚Äôs quite flat. Weirdly a bit like a flat hefeweiss. Taste is quite sweet with fruit and a little spicing. Leads to a lingering, dry finish with some banana notes. Too sweet for me.</p>

<p>La Guillotine Quite pale, slightly hazy, with a long-lasting white head. Slight citrus nose, with a touch of sweet malts. Fizzy on the tongue, some lemony citrys and a dryness from the hops. There‚Äôs a kick of alcohol, but it‚Äôs well disguised by the other flavours and they dry aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Kerkom</p>

<p>Bink Blond Slight haze to the golden colour. Smells quite sweet. A bit of fizz in the mouth. Not too exciting, there‚Äôs some alcohol and sweetness with a hint of clove and some light smoke notes. Finish is quite sticky.</p>

<p>Bink Bruin Very dark malt with a reddish tinge. Lots of malt and dark fruit (raisins and dates). Quite sweet with some alcohol notes and a full mouthfeel.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Liefmans</p>

<p>Goudenband Red-brown in colour, with a large, frothy tan head. Smells sour - very much like Rodenbach Grand Cru. Quite tart and sour, with an additional drying aftertaste. There‚Äôs also a little sweetness. Complex and interesting, but I still prefer the Grand Cru.</p>

<p>Liefmans Gl√ºhkriek If you like kriek and/or gl√ºwein, then you‚Äôll probably like this. I like neither. Warm cherry beer.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Lindemans</p>

<p>Kriek Foudroyante Cherry red in colour with a slight foam of pinkish head. Smells like cherry drops. Sweetness from the cherry and sourness from the lambic. Surprisingly well balanced but some strange sherbet notes.</p>

<p>Lindemans Apple Lots of head retention. Crisp and apply, although I wonder what the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù flavours they‚Äôve added are, as it tastes like apple sweets. Couldn‚Äôt drink a lot of it, but it‚Äôs not as poor as I thought it was going to be.</p>

<p>Lindemans Cuv√©e Ren√© Clear golden with lots of tiny bubbles and good white lacing. Smells musty, sour with some tartness and a little funk. Taste is similar, but not too much tartness. Lingering sourness in the finish. Very drinkable; would probably make a good introduction to gueuzes.</p>

<p>Lindemans Faro Lambic Smells slightly sour and fruity. Dark tea coloured with no head. Not too fizzy. Nice mouthfeel, only slightly sour with a citrus aftertaste. Some sweetness and fruit in the finish. This is an incredibly interesting beer, which is very drinkable. Half of my bottle escaped to the other people in the room!</p>

<p>Lindemans Gueuze Smells of sweet vinegar. Dark golden with very little head. Taste is oddly sweet/sour. Also some stickiness. Generally a bit odd, and not a great example of a gueuze.</p>

<p>Lindemans Gueuze Lambic Highly carbonated, hazy dark amber. Smells dry, with a slight sourness and some yeast. Fizzy mouthfeel, but boy is this tart! A long drying tart finish. I like tart beers, but this perhaps takes it too far.</p>

<p>Lindemans Tea Beer Golden amber, some carbonation. Slightly cloudy with absolutely no head. Smells mostly of fruit, possibly cherries. Very tart - sour cherries. Tea very hard to pick out, you‚Äôd never get it unless you knew what it was. Some slight sweet stickiness. More like cider than tea. Quite drinkable.</p>

<p>Pecheresse Mid brown colour with a little carbonation. Smells slightly of peach with a little sourness, so what you‚Äôd expect. Sweet peach dominates, with a (very) little dryness in the finish. Reminiscent of cider.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Louwaege</p>

<p>Hapkin Apparently a Duvel copy, but quite different. Slightly cloudy golden colour with a huge head. Nose is distinctively Belgian with candy sugar and some spice. Sweet and strong taste with yeast and citrus flavours. I got bored of it.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Lupus</p>

<p>Wolf 8 Very dark, pretty much black, with a very tight, white head. Dark, roasted malt and some bitterness in the aroma. Good lacing. Lots of fizz with roasted malt, liquorice, and some bitterness (hop-like) and cocoa dryness in the finish. Much better when it‚Äôs not as gassy, as then it‚Äôs very smooth and well-rounded.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Oude Beersel</p>

<p>Oude Gueuze Hazy light golden with a tight, frothy white head. Must sourness - smells like a gueuze should. Prickly mouthfeel. Some sourness and sharpness in the taste, but not overpowering and not as strong as it smells.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Rodenbach</p>

<p>Caractere Rouge Red with white head. Smells of cherries with some sourness. Tastes similar with a bit of sticky sweetness. Worryingly drinkable.</p>

<p>Rodenbach Classic (Red) Ruby coloured, with an initial sour cherry hit. Unlike the Grand Cru, the sourness fades after the initial hit. Enough maltiness/sweetness to keep it drinkable. A good introduction to sour beers.</p>

<p>Rodenbach Grand Cru Very dark red with little head but a decent amount of lacing. Smells sweet and sour, with some fruity notes. Initial sourness isn‚Äôt overpowering, and is balanced by a slight sweetness, which makes it very well rounded. Despite the sourness, it‚Äôs actually very refreshing. Some carbonation, which works really well.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Roman</p>

<p>Adrian Brouwer Dark Gold Despite the name, its very dark, with ruby hues. Has a huge, frothy tan head which goes down to a finger pretty quickly. Some sweetness and alcohol on the nose. Very powerful taste. Fizz and alcohol hit you initially, followed by malt and dark fruit. A lot of fizz.</p>

<p>Black Hole Very clear golden with a tight white head. Smells lagery with some sweetness. Taste is sweet and clean, and very thin. Slightly metallic in the finish.</p>

<p>Ename Tripel Pale golden, slightly hazy, some carbonation and frothy head. Candy sugar aroma, continuing into the initial taste. Honey and a chalky dryness. Quite high ABV and needs to do something more interesting for my money.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Slaghmuylder</p>

<p>Witkap Livinus Hay golden with very little head. Aroma has some hops, a little candy sugar and some alcohol. Fizzy mouthfeel. Taste has some spice, similar to a spiced rum. Tingly and lasting alcohol notes. Very full aftertaste, which is slightly metallic at the end.</p>

<p>Witkap Pater Tripel Blonde beer, quite cloudy and smells how you‚Äôd expect from a tripel, earthy, with a hint of citrus and sweetness. Actually, the smell is hard to define. Smooth, not too fizzy, and very well rounded. Not much of an aftertaste, and worryingly drinkable.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Slappmutske</p>

<p>Slaapmutske Blond Pale golden, slightly hazy and a very fine white head. Sweet candyfloss notes with banana and mango esters. Very tripel-like with lots of fizz, definite alcohol notes and a bit of a metallic tang. Surprisingly smooth mouthfeel, although it does get a bit sticky.</p>

<p>Slaapmutske Bruin Dark brown with ruby hints and a slightly off-white head. Smells of red fruit and roasted malt. Taste is similar with lots of fizz. Generally ok, but a bit too fizzy to be great.</p>

<p>Slaapmutske Tripel White head and from the aroma it‚Äôs definitely alcoholic and sticky. Not actually a huge amount of taste. Lots of carbonation. Taste has some malt and lots of caramel sugar with a bit of yeast. Reminiscent of chewy sweets. Doesn‚Äôt do enough to justify the ABV.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij St. Bernardus</p>

<p>St. Bernardus Abt 12 Hazy brown with good lacing. Smells of ripe fruit and sweet malt, some spice. Tastes dark and complex, and manages to hide the alcohol. Some brown sugar, spices (clove?) and dried fruit. Very nice.</p>

<p>St. Bernardus Christmas Ale Cloudy and brown. Smells of coriander seeds with some citrus bitterness. Has a fruity, almost gueuze-like taste. Really fizzy in the mouth, yet somehow manages to be creamy at the same time. Long lasting, tingly finish with alcohol notes. Not exciting enough for the alcohol hit.</p>

<p>St. Bernardus Pierre Celis Wit Hazy yellow with a small white head around the edge of the glass. Smells wheat with some lemon and orange citrus notes. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Clean tasting with citrus notes, especially in the finish. Quite a rich overall mouthfeel.</p>

<p>St. Bernardus Prior 8 Dark, slightly hazy brown with a ruby tinge. Small bubbly head. Well carbonated. A little alcohol in the nose, with some dark fruit. Taste has some dark malt, with breadiness and alcohol. Also a little coffee. Tastes a bit thin and washed out.</p>

<p>St. Bernardus Tripel Hazy pale amber, not much lacing. Smells slightly of alcohol with some fruit. Slightly creamy mouthfeel with some wheat and hops. Slightly dry finish.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Straffe Hendrik</p>

<p>Bruges Zot Hazy golden with a lingering frothy head. Smells lemony with some woody notes. Quite astringent with strong lemon and herbal notes. Some bready notes lead to a drying finish.</p>

<p>Straffe Hendrik Golden, slightly hazy with lots of fine carbonation. Good lacing with a thick white head. Smells of citrus with a slight metallic overtone. Smooth, rounded taste with a strong alcohol burn. Some honey/caramel notes. Dry, possibly slightly musty finish. Alcohol is a little too overpowering.</p>

<p>Straffe Hendrik Quadrupel Very dark brown with tight tan head with good lacing. Smells sweet and spicy. Taste is similar with some liquorice notes. Definitely a sipping beer.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Strubbe</p>

<p>Keyte Ostendse Dobbel Tripel Dark, reddy brown with a slightly off-white head. Smells of dark fruit, red wine/port and roasted malt. Slightly sour with a sweeter finish with further port notes and quite heavy tannins.</p>

<p>Keyte Ostendse Tripel Lightly hazy golden with very little white head. Smells alcoholic eight a bit of citrus. Quite flat with dryness and warmth. Some citrus and spice in the mouth, but not overly interesting given the ABV.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Timmermans</p>

<p>Timmermans Faro Amber with a white head. Smells of apples and wood. Quite tart, although there‚Äôs also some candy sugar. Not as sour as other beers of the same style, and also lacking in complexity.</p>

<p>Timmermans Lambicus Blanche Hazy pale golden with quickly-vanishing bubbles of white head. Smells both sweet and sour, like homemade lemonade. Definite notes of a witbier. Good tingle of carbonation in the mouth. Taste is bright with lemon at the state, leading to light malt and a little spice, and then returning to a nicely tart finish. Very well balanced; this is a seriously good beer.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Van Eecke</p>

<p>Kapittel Abt Light golden orange colour with enthusiastic amount of fizz. Smells of yeast and some spice. Tingly mouthfeel with a medium body. Some breadiness in the taste, along with some spice.</p>

<p>Kapittel Blonde Cloudy, pale golden with white bubbly head. Some hops and candy sugar in the aroma - certainly smells very Belgian. Some wheat banana flavour. Pretty smooth with a little tingle in the mouth. Tastes pretty strong, with a little earthiness in the finish.</p>

<p>Kapittel Dubbel Ruby red with a large frothy head, which is slightly off-white. Lots of roasted malt aroma, with a little sweetness. Taste is bitter malt with some sweetness. Too sweet.</p>

<p>Kapittel Pater Hazy brown with a small head which has good retention. Caramel sweetness in the nose, along with some flowery hops. Initial tart taste leads to sweetness and dark malt. Not bad, but not brilliant either.</p>

<p>Kapittel Prior Dark brown with good lacing. Smells sweet with definite alcohol notes. Taste is dominated by dark fruit, and the mouthfeel is a bit prickly. Drinkable, but not overly exciting.</p>

<p>Poperings Hommel Looks Belgian with the distinctive lacing. Golden coloured. Smells slightly sweet with some herbs and spice. Very crisp with plenty of carbonation. Dry malts lead to a hoppy finish. Hoppier than you‚Äôd expect from a Belgian beer.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Van Honsebrouck</p>

<p>Kasteel Blonde Very clear amber colour, with a few fine streams of carbonation and a thin slick of head. Smells very clean, faint alcohol notes, along with some sweetness and a little grass. Not as exciting as some other blondes. Clean taste, some sweetness and a little spice with a nicely bitter finish.</p>

<p>Kasteel Brune Dark brown with a reddish hue. Large white head. Smells slightly bready. Taste is sweet with some dark fruit. Lingering sweet aftertaste with some alcohol notes. Some carbonation, but a fairly thick mouthfeel. A bit too strong and sweet.</p>

<p>Kasteel Cuv√©e Du Chateau Very dark with fine bubbles of off-white head.  Smells strong and sweet. Tastes simiar with too much of both.  Tastes like treacle, with a bit of spice and some more sweetness. Not very nice at all.</p>

<p>Kasteel Hoppy Clear golden with very small white head. Smells grassy with some flowery notes. Actually quite hoppy, with flowery and slightly bitter notes. Pretty good.</p>

<p>Kasteel Rouge To be honest, not what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be a standard Belgian ‚Äúred‚Äù. Actually, it looks like cherry juice with little head. Smells of sweet cherries. Taste is much like a cherry limbic, not too sweet. Some alcohol notes in the finish. Not sure I could drink more than one in a session though.</p>

<p>Kasteel Tripel Amber with a small white foamy head. Lots of slowly-rising fine carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some sugar, almost cider-like. Alcohol jumps out straight away, and there‚Äôs not a huge amount else going on. A little sugary fruit. Lots of carbonation.</p>

<p>St Louis Kriek Lambic Dark cherry red with white, light head. Smells of morello cherries. Tastes like fake cherry sweets with a little almond. Slightly dry, woody finish. Not too much carbonation. Some tang and aspartame notes. Quite sticky after a while.</p>

<p>St. Louis Gueuze Lambic Dark copper colour. Tart, with a traditional gueuze smell, with a touch of fruit. Sour, but well rounded, with strong malts in the middle and a nice mouthfeel.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Van Steenberge</p>

<p>Augustijn Blond Clear and golden with lasting white foam. Smells mildly of malt and a little fruit. Clean mouthfeel with a little candy sugar. Carbonation gives some tingle and it has a lightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>Augustijn Grand Cru Very large white head, frothy, similar to Duvel. Good head retention. Amber, with a high degree of carbonation. Has an initial alcoholic kick, with a fizzy mouthfeel. Surprisingly dry aftertaste.</p>

<p>Celis Wit Cloudy straw colour, with a tight creamy head. Light wheat, some citrus and a little spice in the aroma. Taste is slightly tart, but rounded out by a bready malt. Crisp finish. Quite subtle.</p>

<p>Gentse Tripel Hazy, pale golden with very little head. Aroma is malts, yeast and some sweet biscuit. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel with an acidic, vinegar sourness. A bit bland other than the sourness, has something of white wine about it.</p>

<p>Gulden Draak Reddish brown. Smells very strong with some dark fruits. Lots of alcohol in the taste, with some fruit and sugar sweetness. Like a Belgian barley wine.</p>

<p>Piraat Ale Light golden with a large head, reminiscent of Duvel. Not as bitter or hoppy as you‚Äôd expect from an IPA. Some hops and some pineapple sweetness. Nice blend of hops and fruity sweetness. Surprisingly drinkable considering the ABV, virtually no alcohol kick, just a warming richness.</p>

<p>Piraat Tripel Hop Hazy dark golden/light copper with a very sticky white head. Smells Belgian, with definite alcohol notes. Tastes strong and Leffe-like with orange, spices and Christmas aromas. Triple hopped, but not a huge amount of hop flavour, and also quite sweet.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Van Viven</p>

<p>Viven Porter Very dark with small patches of tan head and a little lacing. Toasted malt with some dryness and chalky notes in the aroma. Mouthfeel is slightly fizzy. Taste is dominated by roasted malt and bitterness, which makes for a very drinkable porter. Some definite smoke notes in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Van den Bossche</p>

<p>Buffalo Belgian Stout Very dark brown with a very large, frothy white head, Smells of roasted malt with some sweetness. Lots of fizz in the mouth, but other than that it‚Äôs quite thin. Not really that stout-like, although there‚Äôs a richness and slight bitterness in the finish. Some chocolate as it warms up, but it also becomes quite sticky.</p>

<p>Buffalo Bitter Slightly hazy golden with a rocky, white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is light with quite a lot of fizz. Some bitterness, but hard to pin down if it‚Äôs from hops or something else. OK, but in no way worth the ABV.</p>

<p>Lamoral Degmont Golden with a large, frothy white head. Smells slightly sweet with alcohol notes and some dryness. Tingly mouthfeel with an alcohol hit. Despite that, it‚Äôs quite light-tasting for a triple.</p>

<p>Pater Lieven Bruin Dark brown. Smells of sweets and alcohol. Quite a lot of fizz and not all that much flavour. Partially saved by some dark fruit in the finish, along with some sweetness. Overall too alcoholic and too dull.</p>

<p>Pater Lieven Tripel Clear golden with a small froth of white head. Smells lightly of banana and caramel. Big fizz in the mouth. A bit of spice and alcohol, with a sour bitterness in the finish. Quite sweet, highly carbonated, and strong.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Verhaeghe</p>

<p>Duchesse De Bourgogone Deep brown-ruby with a sticky white head. Aroma is quite soft with some sour notes and some woodiness. Tate is initially quite tart with apple-like tartness. Finish is drying with a little sweetness keeping it pretty clean. Complex yet very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij Westvleteren</p>

<p>Westvleteren 12 Consistently rated as the best beer in the world, so I was expecting a lot. Dark brown in colour with red tinges. No head, and some sediment from the bottle conditioning. Complex aroma, definite alcohol notes, along with caramel sweetness, carob, and mild dark fruit. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, but very smooth, especially considering the ABV. Malts and some spice, with a twang in the finish, coupled with alcohol dryness. Also some raisin/Christmas pudding flavours and chocolate. Finish is dry and slightly chalky, with warming - but not overpowering - alcohol notes. A very, very good beer. Note: The bottle I had was kept for at least two years.</p>

<p>Westvleteren 8 Dark copper with an almost white head. Smells complex with alcohol, spices and malty sweetness. Medium fizz in the mouth. Bittersweet with some malt, leads to a well-rounded aftertaste. Definitely more like an English ale than a traditional take on a dubbel.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij der St. Benedictusabdij de Achelse</p>

<p>Trappist Achel 5¬∞ Blond Golden coloured with a large, frothy head. Very fizzy. Floral and slightly fruity aroma, but not too strong, probably due to the large head. Smooth with an initial sweetness followed by a hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Trappist Achel 8¬∞ Blond Golden coloured with a large, frothy head which lingers. Some lemon in the aroma, along with some malt. Slightly spicy with a nice level of carbonation; very drinkable.</p>

<p>Trappist Achel 8¬∞ Brune Dark brown with a large head. Some bready yeast and malts, maybe a little spice. Quite creamy, which makes it a little dull.</p>

<p>### Brouwerij van Hoegaarden</p>

<p>Hoegaarden Ros√© Hazy, with a large head. Smells of fruit, perhaps blackberries or redcurrants. Very sweet, like pineapple cubes in syrup. Has a watery aftertaste. Pretty much undrinkable.</p>

<p>### Browar Okocim</p>

<p>Pszeniczne Hazy yellow-orange with foamy white head. Looks a lot like a Belgian wittier. Smells similar as well, with wheat dominant along with some citrus. Smooth mouthfeel, again with some citrus notes. Clean weissbier taste and mouthfeel. Nicely drinkable.</p>

<p>### Browerij Alken-Maes</p>

<p>Grimbergen Blonde Golden colour with a white head that leaves lots of lacing. Quite a musky smell with some citrus coming through. Sweet and dry with some malt and a reasonably bitter finish. Drinkable but a little disappointing.</p>

<p>Grimbergen Optimo Bruno Dark brown, with little head. Smells of sour fruit. Some sourness, spice and alcohol notes. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, with a definite warming aftertastes. A bit too thin for the ABV.</p>

<p>Grimbergen Tripel Cloudy yellow with a large fluffy white head. Smells sweet with some ripe fruit. Taste is typical for a tripel, with light fruit going into a dry bitterness. Nicely carbonated, but I was underwhelmed.</p>

<p>### Browerij De Smedt</p>

<p>Affligem Blond Large frothy white head. Smells slightly hoppy and spicy. Tastes quite strong. Has a fizzy mouthfeel with a little sweetness and spice.</p>

<p>Affligem Dubbel Mahogany with patches of white head. Smells sweet and spicy. Tastes similar with plenty going on. Some alcohol noted. Complex, but perhaps a bit unbalanced, with yeast, caramel sweetness and some dryness. Still, it‚Äôs a very impressive beer.</p>

<p>Affligem Patersvat Blond Golden with a bit of fizz and a white head. A clean, light beer. Like a helles crossed with a regular blonde. Easy-drinking, especially given the ABV.</p>

<p>Postel Blond Pale yellow with a large, white frothy head. Small streams of carbonation. Aroma has esters, maybe some sweetness and some alcohol notes, Quite bright and tingly mouthfeel. Smooth and long-lasting. Some sweetness and faint alcohol notes mix with a butteriness.</p>

<p>### Browerij Westmalle</p>

<p>Westmalle Dubbel Dark, rich brown colour with a lasting tan head. Smell is mostly caramel with some fruit. Smooth mouthfeel with sweet malts and some caramel, which turns into a dry hoppiness and a little spice. Slightly dry finish with an alcohol warmth.</p>

<p>Westmalle Tripel Cloudy pale orange with a good head. Smells spicy with some pale malt and citrus, and the obligatory alcohol. Quite crisp but a little oily. Fruit followed by spice and some sweetness ‚Äì very complicated.</p>

<p>### Budels</p>

<p>### Burning Sky</p>

<p>Monolith Very dark with a tight dark tan head.  Smells slightly sour with red wine notes. Quite a fizzy mouth feel, but ends with a smooth finish. Definite chocolate notes. Very well rounded with some tannin dry flavours that build. Complex and interesting. Definitely don‚Äôt notice the abv.</p>

<p>Plateau Bright golden with tight white head. Fruity hops in the nose. Very well balanced with a mix of tropical fruit and a lingering bitterness. Excellent session beer.</p>

<p>### Burning Soul</p>

<p>### Burnside</p>

<p>### Burton Bridge</p>

<p>Bramble Stout Very strong chocolate aroma, with a little fruit, although it‚Äôs hard to notice. Very full-bodied with a long lasting aftertaste and bitterness, but not too harsh.</p>

<p>Damson Porter Brewed in the same way as Burton Dark Porter, and then damson juice is added. Very dark brown in colour, with an unsurprisingly fruity nose. Palate is bitter-sweet, with some hops but mostly fruitiness.</p>

<p>Pacifica Golden with bubbles of white head. Slight fruity hop aroma. Clean with a hop bitter finish with tropical fruit notes.</p>

<p>### Bushys</p>

<p>Manx Bitter Smells of pale malt and hops. Mostly hop flavour with the accompanying bitterness.</p>

<p>### Butcombe</p>

<p>Brunel IPA Very clear, light copper with a quickly-vanishing just off-white head. Smells of hops, both fruity and bitter, along with an alcohol tang. Tingly mouthfeel, with some bitter and slightly green hops, but not a whole lot else. Smokey notes appear when the fizz calms down.</p>

<p>Butcombe Bitter Copper with lots of large bubbles of carbonation and a bubbly, slightly off-white head. Smells malty and hoppy. Tingly mouthfeel. Dry, bitter and clean. Very drinkable; well rounded with good hopping. Excellent (if slightly strong) session beer.</p>

<p>### Buxton</p>

<p>Trolltunga Yellow with bubbly white head. Huge amount of gooseberry aroma. Loads of sourness. Definitely a sipping beer, but incredibly drinkable.</p>

<p>Amarillo IPA Golden with a clean, hoppy aroma. Dry and malty with loads of hops and some light fruit notes.</p>

<p>Big Cat Golden with white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma has malt and some fruit hops. Taste is similar. A very drinkable session beer.</p>

<p>Blackfriars Porter Very dark reddish brown with large, frothy off-white head (definitely bottle conditioned). Smells of dark berries and roasted malt. Quite fizzy. Tangy with some light berry flavour (but not fruity) and a slightly toasted finish. A bit too fizzy, but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>Columbo Slightly hazy golden with a small, tight white head. Smells slightly sweet with hop fruity notes and floweriness. Quite dry with grapefruit pith hopiness and a lingering dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>Coventry Bitter Orangey amber with a small head. Strong aroma of hops and other green notes. Taste is dominated by tea-like hops with a little biscuity malt to balance. Very nice session beer.</p>

<p>Crystal Cookie Copper with foamy just-off-white head. Smells of biscuity malt with dark fruit notes. Blackcurrant dominates the taste with a nice hop bitterness. A bit confusing.</p>

<p>Madagascar Stout Vanilla stout. Very dark with a reddish tinge. Quite a lot of fizz, leading to a large, frothy light brown head. Some sweetness in the aroma along with roasted bitterness. Quite fizzy with a definite tingle in the mouth. Subtle and not overpoweringly vanilla though.</p>

<p>Phoenix Gold Pours a dark gold with a slightly rocky white head, which has ok retention. Aroma is flowery, with hops and some herb/grass undertone. Crisp tasting with a nicely sharp bitterness and balancing light malt. This is a seriously drinkable light ale. It seems that Byatt‚Äôs is going to become an excellent Coventry brewery. Would be excellent with spicy food or just as a summer thirst quencher.</p>

<p>Regal Blond Straw coloured with a large, rocky white head. Smells of citrus hops with some green notes. Also some pineapple-like fruit. Crisp and tangy with plenty of hops and a little sweetness. Just as good as the Phoenix Gold.</p>

<p>XK Dark Very dark with a small, tan head. Smells of dark fruit, possibly some coffee and chocolate. Very full tasting with coffee, roasted malt and some light, burnt bitterness. Very complex with a bitter, dry finish with some warming alcohol notes (which is surprising given the ABV.</p>

<p>XK Strong Very dark with tan head. Loads of roast malt in the aroma. Rich and full bodied. Very drinkable. Good example of a strong mild.</p>

<p>XXV Copper, with a froth of white head. Smells slightly fruity. Lots of fizz in the mouth, with fruit, alcohol and bitterness. Tagline is ‚ÄòA real ale for real fans - because it‚Äôs hard being a sky blue‚Äô. I would have gone with ‚ÄòGoes down about as well as Coventry City‚Äô. Interesting, but a bit too strong.</p>

<p>XXXmas Ale Very black with a small tan head. Acetone notes in the aroma, along with bubble liquid. Smokey taste with dark fruit. Quite rich mouthfeel with some bitterness to cut through in the finish. Nasty smell disappears as it warms up, which is nice if unexpected.</p>

<p>### Cairngorm</p>

<p>Black Gold Jet black, pours with a large tan head. Smells of roasted malt with some coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is similar, with nutty notes and a good bitterness. Nice, full body with a lot of flavour.</p>

<p>Blessed Thistle Amber coloured with little carbonation. Some malt and caramel with perhaps a little spice. Definitely some ginger in there as well, but it‚Äôs not overpowering.</p>

<p>Cairngorm Gold Golden with a bubbly white head. Slightly bitter hop aroma, but not a lot going on. Fizzy mouthfeel. Actually tastes quite lagery (more pils than helles) but is nicely drinkable. Perhaps a little smokiness in the finish.</p>

<p>Nessie‚Äôs Monster Mash Dark brown/red, with a creamy head. Aroma is fruity, perhaps plums, with some bready malt. Tastes quite sweet, with little carbonation. Some toffee and caramel notes, quite warming. Good, but perhaps too sweet to have more than one.</p>

<p>Sheepshaggers Gold Golden with little head. Smells of light, sweet malts, but pretty subtle. Body is a bit watery, with vegetable and malt flavours. Underwhelming.</p>

<p>Stag Clear brown with good head retention. Smells very malty, with no hops. Faint smokiness. Taste is similar, with bread and good, bitter hops and a slightly peppery finish. Not too fizzy.</p>

<p>Trade Winds Straw gold with a frothy white head. Smells of floral hops with some citrus notes and a bit of spice. Tastes similar, with some tropical fruit notes as well. Finish is long and citrusy with some resin. Very nice light ale.</p>

<p>### Caledonian</p>

<p>Caledonian 80/- Brown with a reddish hue. Thick white head. Smells Sweet and malty. Taste is more balanced, sweet to start with, backed up by malt and finished with a good hop bitterness. Not too much carbonation.</p>

<p>Cunning as a Bag of Weasels Light copper with tight white head. Smells sweet and malty. Quite fizzy. Pretty standard with a decent balance of malt and hops.</p>

<p>Deuchers IPA Sharp, citrus smell. Quite fizzy, perhaps too much so to be a good session beer. Not a great IPA - missing some hop bitterness, I think, although certainly drinkable.</p>

<p>Distant Sun Light copper with tight white head. Some orange and malt in the aroma. Orange bitterness. OK.</p>

<p>Flying Scotsman Dark copper with a large, tight white head. Smells of roasted, almost burnt malt and caramel, with the associated sweetness. Reminds me of homebrew. Not too fizzy, with a full mouthfeel. Roasted flavour, quite dry, and some spice in the finish.</p>

<p>Kiss Me Quick Dark amber, slightly red. Creamy head with good lacing. Smells of toffee with some spiciness. Taste is much the same with a light carbonation. Good session beer, similar to Hobgoblin.</p>

<p>Unmistakably Bill‚Äôs Copper, very fizzy pour, with rapidly vanishing sticky head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Malt, some fruit hops and a little bitterness. Nothing really special.</p>

<p>### Camden Town</p>

<p>India Hells Lager Very pale golden with white bubbly head. Lots of resinous US-style hops in the nose. Citrus hops with resinous notes, slightly sticky mouth feel. Bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Ink Jet black with creamy bubbles of tan head. Roasted aroma. Very smooth with only light carbonation. Lots of roasted, bitter flavours. Lingering, bitter finish rounds off a full-bodied, roasted beer.</p>

<p>### Camerons</p>

<p>Road Crew Collaboration with Motorhead. Amber with white head. Light floral and slightly perfumed aroma. Taste is similar but dominated by bitterness and some sweetness in the finish. Meh.</p>

<p>### Campbell‚Äôs</p>

<p>Gunner Hazy golden with sticky white head. Loads of grain and vegetable in the aroma. Taste is similarly grainy, with a lingering hop bitterness in the finish and some sweet, honey notes. Distinctly OK.</p>

<p>### Campervan Brewery</p>

<p>Spelty Spice A saison with a lot going on. You can taste the orange and cardamom. Apparently also has tea in it, and there‚Äôs definitely a bit of smokiness. Quite funky and interesting, but perhaps a bit too much going on.</p>

<p>### Carbon Smith</p>

<p>Mooze Jet black with bubbles of off-white head. Loads of malt in the aroma. Very drying with a lot of bitterness in the finish, backed up by a good malt body.</p>

<p>### Carlsberg Danmark</p>

<p>Carlsberg Straw with a big white head. Smells of stale water with some grain and skunkiness. Taste is similar. Generic, poor lager. Best served very cold.</p>

<p>Schous Pils It‚Äôs a pilsner, and, being in Norway, a particularly expensive one. Clear golden, cereal/grass aroma, soft mouthfeel. Slightly sweet finish.</p>

<p>Tuborg Gold Sold as Den Gyldne Dame (the golden lady) in Denmark. It‚Äôs a clear, golden, somewhat grassy lager. Nice cold sat on a warm night by the harbour in Copenhagen. Probably not recommended otherwise.</p>

<p>### Carlton &amp; United Breweries</p>

<p>Victoria Bitter (VB) Yellow-light-gold in color with a reasonable head. Smells of lager, with a bit more malt than you‚Äôd expect. A little grass and grain in the taste. A bit watery but inoffensive and easy to drink.</p>

<p>### Cassels</p>

<p>Alchemist Golden with white head. Aroma has lemon and orange. Similar taste with an initial grassiness and a bitter, citrus finish.</p>

<p>American Pale Ale Golden with patchy white head. Strong aroma of tropical fruit. Similar initial taste, very clean, with a building resin bitterness. Surprisingly short aftertaste. Very nice session beer.</p>

<p>Dunkel Let‚Äôs be honest; this isn‚Äôt really a dunkel, it‚Äôs a fizzy stout. Black with very little head. Slightly sweet with a bitter, dry finish and quite a lot of carbonation.</p>

<p>Lager Pale golden with no head. Smells like a lager with some grain and a bit of sweetness. Yep, it‚Äôs a lager.</p>

<p>Milk Stout Black with off-white head. Smells malty with some chocolate notes. Very full and smooth with an initial sweetness and a slightly burnt, bitter finish.</p>

<p>One P.A. Golden with lacy white head. Smells and tastes of resinous hops with a bitter, drying finish. Some tropical fruit notes.</p>

<p>Pale Ale Golden with very small white head. Floral aroma. Quite a lot of bitterness in the finish. Pretty good.</p>

<p>Pilsner Golden with fine streams of carbonation. Smells grassy. Taste is slightly green with a zesty punch and bitter, building aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Castle Rock</p>

<p>Black Gold Dark brown with a tight, light tan head. Smells surprisingly hoppy (with both citrus and resin notes) with a slight bitterness of roast malt. Tastes a lot lighter than it looks, with some roasted notes but a good hint of hops as well.</p>

<p>Elsie Mo Pale yellow with a large, frothy white head. Hop dryness dominates the aroma. Very clean-tasting with light malt and dry hops which have a nice, lingering bitterness. Also definite alcohol notes. Almost like a good, hoppy Belgian pale ale.</p>

<p>### Castor</p>

<p>CC IPA Golden. Lots of grassy and citrus hop aroma. Contains Chelan, Columbus, Chinook and Cascade. Taste backs up the smell, with the addition of a lingering bitter-sweet finish.</p>

<p>### Cathedral</p>

<p>Red Imp Copper coloured, slightly bitter and fizzy. A bit dull with a tingly mouthfeel.</p>

<p>### Celt Experience</p>

<p>Celt Golden Organic ale, which was frankly quite disappointing. Bronze in colour, with an aroma dominated by malt, and a little dirtiness. Taste is unexciting and a bit unpleasant at times.</p>

<p>### Cervejaria Sul Brasilereira</p>

<p>Xingu Black lager inspired by Amazonian indians. Very smooth pour with a small, thin tan head. Little aroma. Fizzy mouthfeel with some malts and spice.</p>

<p>### Chapel Down Winery</p>

<p>Curious Porter Dark brown with ruby hints. Smells chocolatey. Nicely rounded with roasted malt and a bit of bitterness in a good, lingering finish. Easy to drink, but perhaps a bit thin.</p>

<p>### Cheddar Brewery</p>

<p>Totty Pot Dark in colour, smells quite burnt/bitter in a coffee-like way. Thinish mouthfeel, mostly malt in the finish.</p>

<p>### China Resources Breweries</p>

<p>Snow Beer Pours a clear, very light yellow. Small amount of carbonation. No real aroma, maybe some yeast. Very light taste, malt with a slight sweetness but a very watery finish. Easy drinking, but genuinely dull.</p>

<p>### Church End</p>

<p>Ales Well That Ends Well Golden bitter with some aroma of hops. A little bland, could do with more hopping, but reasonably drinkable nonetheless.</p>

<p>Arthur‚Äôs Wit Pours very light goldens and clear, despite being bottle conditioned. Very fizzy on the pour, with lots of fine carbonation and fizzing head. Medium-fizzy mouthfeel wit plenty of hops (both citrus and bitter) and some light malt. Drinkable, with a long-lasting fry aftertaste.</p>

<p>Fallen Angel Golden colour, with a small frothy head. Very bitter, bordering on unbalanced, but nicely refreshing. Lingering bitter aftertaste.</p>

<p>Gravediggers Mild Very dark with a white head. Some chocolate sweetness mixed with roasted malts. For some reason it just tastes weird.</p>

<p>Hop Gun Pale golden, no fizz at all and a very small head. Smells a little vegetable. Surprisingly, some fizz in the mouth. Generally ok, but let down by a strange acidic aftertaste.</p>

<p>Karl‚Äôs Berg As the name suggests, this is an attempt at brewing a lagery real ale. Pale and lightly hopped, it gets some way of the way there. Unfortunately, it smells a little dirty and is generally uninspiring.</p>

<p>Pooh Beer Very pale golden. Made with honey, which is very obvious. Tastes of honey and has a stickiness that builds. If you like honey, try it, otherwise leave it for the bees.</p>

<p>Seahorse Mid brown colour. Slightly fruity and bitter. Some malt sweetness changes to mostly hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Vicar‚Äôs Ruin Hazy orange with small bubbly head. Aroma is fruity with some sweetness. Taste is fruit with a mild bitterness and some grassy hops. Simple but drinkable.</p>

<p>What The Foxes Hat Mid brown with a tight white head. No real aroma but taste is nicely balanced with fruit and hop flavours and a little malt. Drinkable and a good session beer.</p>

<p>### Church Farm</p>

<p>Black IPA Very dark. Smells quite hoppy and dry. Tastes the same, with a very dry finish. Like a cross between an IPA and a stout. Very nice.</p>

<p>Ren‚Äôs Pride Amber in colour. Smells of vegetables and fruit with some sourness in the aroma. Not sure this one was quite right. Apparently should be generously hopped. Not awful, but getting there.</p>

<p>### Clarks</p>

<p>Classic Blonde Straw coloured with small creamy head. Smells of hops. Sweet malts and a dry, bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Cloudwater</p>

<p>Bergamot Sour Hazy yellow with no head. Definitely smells of bergamot and maybe some lemon citrus? Definitely a sour! Tart with a lingering finish that I can‚Äôt quite place - slightly musty but not unpleasant. Interesting, but doesn‚Äôt blow me away.</p>

<p>### Cloudwater/Duration</p>

<p>Fool For You Hazy dark copper with small white head. Definitely a Saison with the standard funk. Some grapefruit in there, especially in the finish, but more sweet than sour. Interesting, of a little sticky and unexciting.</p>

<p>### Coach House</p>

<p>Cheshire Gold Dark golden with a small white head. Light citrus aroma with slight resinous hops. Taste is resinous lemon, but clean and refreshing. Very drinkable; a good summer session beer.</p>

<p>Flintlock Pale Ale Pale golden with slight vinegar notes in the aroma. Fortunately they don‚Äôt come through in the taste, which is very much like that of a helles, with some sweet malt. Pretty well rounded, but the smell is off-putting.</p>

<p>### Coastal Brewery</p>

<p>Hopnotic Very hazy dark golden/copper with no head. Smells of white spirit and vinegar. Very thin mouthfeel. Some spice and alcohol, with hops in the finish. Pretty average, but tastes a lot better than it smells.</p>

<p>Hoptimum Hazy dark golden with a very small white head. Smells very sweet and weirdly fruity. Quite thin, mostly just hop dryness and some resin notes. Apparently brewed with six hops.</p>

<p>West Coast IPA Slightly hazy golden. Smells weirdly of fake fruit. Very thin in the mouth. Sweet with a bit of caramel taste. Strange medicine notes; reminds me of calpol. Quite strongly flavoured, but not really in a good way. Also tastes overly alcoholic.</p>

<p>### Cobra Beer Ltd</p>

<p>Cobra Fairly generic lager, but not too gassy. Good with a curry, but otherwise overly bland.</p>

<p>### Compass</p>

<p>Baltic Night Jet black with a very thin tan head. Smells very rich, with some coffee notes. Some bitterness and plenty of roasted malt with coffee overtones. Also some smokiness. Very quaffable.</p>

<p>Isis Copper with a very small white head. Full mouthfeel. Plenty going on, with a good balance of bitterness and malt, with plenty of hops in the finish.</p>

<p>### Concrete Cow</p>

<p>Pail Ale Light in colour, brewed with lager malts. Doesn‚Äôt actually smell or taste of all that much, so probably a good lager replacement.</p>

<p>### Coniston Brewery</p>

<p>Bluebird Bitter Clear and bright, golden in colour. Smells of citrus with a little malt sweetness. Very light, with perhaps not enough biddy. Some malts and a hop bitterness. Nicely carbonated from the bottle conditioning. Dry finish, which becomes more pronounced the more you drink.</p>

<p>Coniston XB Clear golden with no head. Slight citrus fruit aroma. Similar in taste with some lemon. Slightly fizzy but very clean and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Conwy</p>

<p>Welsh Pride Dark copper with a white, frothy head. Smells slightly hoppy. Some fizz in the mouth. Quite malty with a bit of hop in the finish. A pretty standard bitter.</p>

<p>### Coopers</p>

<p>Extra Strong Vintage Ale Brown in colour, very hazy with lots of floating yeast sediment (perhaps should have been poured more carefully). Smells perfumey. Lots of fizz in the mouth. Tastes clean with some warming alcohol and sticky sweetness at the end. A bit like cola bottles. Definitely a sipping beer, and a very enjoyable one at that.</p>

<p>Original Pale Ale Pale golden in colour, with thin white lacing. Smells of citrus hops, with a little yeast. Quite smooth in the mouth, with a nice crispness. Hops give both citrus and bitterness.</p>

<p>Original Sparkling Ale Slightly hazy golden in colour, with some floating yeast sediment (which you could easily leave in the bottle). Frothy white head. Some sweetness, maybe honey. Quite yeasty and bready, with a nice touch of hop bitterness, especially in the lingering finish.</p>

<p>### Coors</p>

<p>Anim√©e Looks like Smirnoff Ice, tastes like Bud top. Why??</p>

<p>M&amp;B Brew XI Copper amber, with a white head. Smells pretty bland, just malt really. Taste is slightly bitter. Not great, but if it‚Äôs all they‚Äôve got, not too bad either.</p>

<p>### Cornish Crown</p>

<p>IPA Golden with very little head. Some fruity resinous hops in the aroma. Taste is clean with a nice bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Coronado Brewing Company</p>

<p>Hibiscus IPA Orangey pink with no head. Aroma is floral hops with grapefruit citrus. Does indeed taste somewhat of hibiscus, with a dry, grapefruity finish. A very nice, drinkable IPA.</p>

<p>### Corvedale</p>

<p>St George‚Äôs Stout Very dark brown with tight just off-white head. Dark fruit and some sourness in the aroma. Think it may be off.</p>

<p>### Cosmos Brewery</p>

<p>Chang Beer I only every drink this at our local Thai restaurant. It‚Äôs fine with spicy food, but otherwise it‚Äôs a bland, somewhat fizzy lager.</p>

<p>### Cotswold Spring</p>

<p>Keeper Honey wheat beer. Smells of demerera sugar and honey. Taste is similar, but the sweetness is balanced by the wheat and some crisp hops.</p>

<p>### Cottage</p>

<p>Battle of Britain Copper with tight white head. Distinctly average.</p>

<p>Big Boy Dark brass-coloured with a small head. Smells of sweet, roasted malt and some spice. Flavour is nicely spicy and warming with plenty of roast malt to round it out.</p>

<p>Dogfather Light amber colour, with a creamy head. Not a lot of aroma, quite bland with a little hop and malt. Could be a good session beer, but nothing overly exciting.</p>

<p>Duchess Tawny. Small, off-white head. Smells slightly bitter. Quite thin with some bitterness and roast notes. Distinctly average.</p>

<p>E-Type Chestnut colour, with a frothy white head. Smells and tastes sour, with nothing else really going on.</p>

<p>Herald Bronze with a tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Clean tasting, some slight bitterness in the finish. Good session beer.</p>

<p>Sunbeam Tiger Dark copper, with a thick white head. Smells and tastes quite bitter, with some malts and a little sourness. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Whippet of Oz Dark copper with a creamy white head. Smells of malt and yeast. Quite sweet, with some golden syrup taste, along with lots of malt.</p>

<p>### Country Life</p>

<p>Pot Wallop Light copper with no head. Not a huge amount of aroma. However, there‚Äôs plenty of bitterness in the taste, although it‚Äôs perhaps a bit too thin to be outstanding.</p>

<p>### Courage</p>

<p>Best Bitter Amber colour. Smells of sweet malt. Taste is similar with a bittersweet finish. Pretty generic, but nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>Directors Slightly red in colour, quickly disappearing head. Hops and a slight fruity sourness in the aroma. Well balanced, with a little dryness, but nothing exciting. Session beer.</p>

<p>### Cromarty</p>

<p>Ghost Town Porter Jet black with tan head. Loads of roast malt and a bit of smoke in the aroma. Smooth with similar taste to the aroma. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Gorse Flower Saison Pale yellow with small white head. Floral, lemony and slightly spicy aroma. Prickly mouthfeel. Lemon and line citrus with some pepperiness. Lingering, tangy finish.</p>

<p>Happy Chappy Clear golden with small, lacy white head. Fruity and grassy aroma. Good hop bitterness and less green tasting than it smells. Clean and drinkable with a bit of fizz.</p>

<p>Hit The Lip Golden with foamy white head. Aroma of fruity hops. Taste is clean and drinkable with a building hop flavour and bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Rogue Wave Orange with a bit of haze. Aroma has quite a lot going on - grapefruit citrus and zest, some hops and resin notes. Taste is similar. It‚Äôs good, but not sure it does enough to justify the ABV.</p>

<p>White Out Golden with a bubbly white head. Aroma of fruit; taste is also fruity (pineapple/orange) with a bittersweet finish. Quite thin.</p>

<p>### Cropton</p>

<p>Top of the Hops Brewed with 2012 varieties (for some definition of variety) of experimental hops. Copper, with a creamy white head. Unsurprisingly tastes of hops, with bitterness, grass notes and a slight dirtiness. A bit odd.</p>

<p>### Crossboarders</p>

<p>IPA Very punchy with resin, dry hops and bitterness. Not too fizzy. Drinkable with a dry and resinous finish.</p>

<p>India Porter Very dark brown with foamy, off-white head. Spicy, alcoholic aroma. Relatively thin mouthfeel with a hit of hop bitterness and a slightly resinous finish.</p>

<p>Porter Very dark with a smooth, tan-brown head. Aroma has roasted malt, some sweet chocolate notes and a hint of coffee. Mouthfeel is very smooth, somewhat too smooth. Taste is similar to the aroma. Could do with a little more going on.</p>

<p>### Crouch Vale</p>

<p>Brewers Gold Smells of tropical fruits, coriander and citrus. Very pale, with a surprising amount of bubbles. Light and refreshing, with a bitter, hoppy finish that lingers on the tongue. Very refreshing, but perhaps a little too bland. Very good session beer.</p>

<p>### Croucher</p>

<p>ANZUS IPA Brewed with one NZ, one Australian and one US hop variety. Golden with lacy white head. Plenty of hop aroma. Good mix of fruity and resinous hops. Very good IPA.</p>

<p>Low Rider Golden. Smells a little sweet. Good hit of bitterness. Very clean and drinkable with some tropical fruit flavour. Very good, especially considering the ABV.</p>

<p>New Zealand Pilsner Very pale golden. Smells a lot fruitier than you‚Äôd expect for a pilsner. Tastes a bit of grapefruit.</p>

<p>Pale Ale Golden with small white head. Good mix of fruity and grassy aromas and flavours. Clean and very drinkable with a tingly mouth feel and very good balance.</p>

<p>Singletrack Centenial Pale golden, little aroma. Quite bitter and drying. Not all that well balanced - maybe the issue with a single hopped beer.</p>

<p>### Cullercoats</p>

<p>Shuggy Boat Blonde Golden with tight white head that leaves good lacing. Fresh, clean, bitter hops in both the aroma and taste. Very drinkable and refreshing.</p>

<p>### D. Carnegie and Co.</p>

<p>Stark-porter Lives up to its name (strong-porter) by looking and smelling like a stout. Roasted, with coffee undertones. Creamy, light brown head that lasts well. Very well rounded, slightly sweet, with a hoppy bitterness. Slight alcoholic aftertaste, very good mouthfeel, and could be drunk until you were.</p>

<p>### Daas</p>

<p>Daas Blonde One of Belgium‚Äôs few organic beers. Creamy head (think Duvel), with lots of carbonation. Very fizzy on the tongue. Manages to taste of a whole lot of nothing. Reminds me of cream soda. Disappointing.</p>

<p>### Dale End</p>

<p>Spring Frenzy Pale orange-golden with a creamy, white head. Smells mostly of malt. Nice, crisp hoppiness to the initial taste, rounded out by some malt and then a slightly drying finish. Good session beer.</p>

<p>### Daleside</p>

<p>Worlds End Ale Medium brown in colour with a large, frothy white head. It‚Äôs a pretty generic bitter, with a decent balance of malt and hops but nothing really exciting going on. Went down nicely in the sunshine though.</p>

<p>### Damm</p>

<p>Estrella It‚Äôs an ok lager. Golden and pretty well balanced with the expected grain notes. Pretty easy drinking when cold.</p>

<p>### Daniel Thwaites Brewery</p>

<p>Double Century CDark amber with a good white head. Lots of carbonations. Smells of light malt with hops. Big malt flavour with some hop bitterness. Surprisingly smooth bodied. Quite drinkable and ok balance.</p>

<p>Indus Pale Ale Golden with a large white, bubbly white head and very little visible carbonation. Smells very hoppy. Clan with some hop fruitiness and a citrus bitterness.</p>

<p>Lancaster Bomber Copper with a nice head, good lacing. Smells of caramel malt with some grain. Taste is a little thin, some malt with a dry finish. What you‚Äôd expect from an English bitter, but a bit unexciting.</p>

<p>Tavern Porter Jet black with a tan head. Smells of bitter chocolate. Fizzy mouthfeel with some sweetness and roast malt. OK, but nothing exciting.</p>

<p>Thwaites Bitter Copper bitter with a standard John Smiths / Tetley maleness. Mild aroma, very smooth in the mouth, perhaps too smooth. Reasonably drinkable, but very dull with a slightly strange aftertaste.</p>

<p>Thwaites Tripel C Golden with a frothy white head. Smells hoppy. Clean and refreshing with a little tingle in the mouth and a slightly dry and bitter finish. You could drink a lot of this.</p>

<p>Thwaites Wainwright Very fizzy mouthfeel, which is quite off-putting. Some hops give it a little dryness, but it‚Äôs generally very unremarkable.</p>

<p>Very Nutty Black Dark brown with a red glow. Smells of biscuity malt and dark fruit. Tastes similar, with a touch if burnt coffee. Drinkable, but a bit thin.</p>

<p>### Dark Star</p>

<p>Espresso Stout Contains freshly ground coffee beans. Jet black, with a small tan head. Unsurprisingly smells almost entirely of coffee; also tastes a lot like coffee, with little else going on. Light carbonation, could possibly do with a little more fizz so you‚Äôre sure it‚Äôs not just coffee. Quite dry and very drinkable.</p>

<p>Revelation Golden with tight white head. Smells and tastes of bitter hops. Bitterness dominates, but there‚Äôs a nice fruitiness in the finish. Surprisingly drinkable, of slightly drying, given the amount of hops in it.</p>

<p>Smoked Porter Black with a small white head. Smells of dark malt with a very small amount of smoke. Smooth taste, which is similar to the aroma. Very drinkable, if a little fizzy.</p>

<p>Sunburst Bright gold. Smells of caramel malts with slight hop notes. Taste is similar with some bitterness in the finish. A bit too sweet.</p>

<p>### Davenport</p>

<p>England‚Äôs Glory Slightly hazy, dark copper, no head. Moderately fizzy mouthfeel. Sweet smell and taste, a little alcohol, but lacking in malt and hops.</p>

<p>Summer Storm Golden in colour with a frothy white head. Smells of pale malt and sour fruit. Very slight tingle on the tongue. Very clean, with a light hop bitterness and a dryish finish. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Dawkins</p>

<p>Pacific IPA Pacific in the sense that it contains American and Australian hops. Smells of resinous, piney hops. Taste is similar. A very good take on an American-style IPA.</p>

<p>### De Leyerth Brouwerijen</p>

<p>Urthel Hop It Honey-coloured and slightly hazy with little head. Honey and floral aroma. A fizzy mouthfeel with distinct alcohol taste. Some hops and perhaps a little honey in the aftertaste. Also some woody herbs. There are some spices (coriander?) which get stronger as it warms up.</p>

<p>Urthel Saisonnie√®re Clear lemon yellow with a large white head. Lots of fine carbonation. Aroma has yeast, banana and some candy sugar. Dry pale malts with a crispness and a strong hop finish. Some spice in the finish as well. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### De Molen</p>

<p>Amarillo Cloudy, dark golden/light copper with a frothy white head. Flowery and slightly bitter hops in the aroma and taste, which also has some fruit notes. A bit astringent in the finish and not as good as some of the other De Molen single hops, although that may be down to hop preference.</p>

<p>Amerikaans Cloudy golden wit a tight, white head. Smells of American-style hops. Good bitterness in the mouth, along with a nice tingle. Also some tropical fruit notes, perhaps from the hops. Clean and very drinkable.</p>

<p>Bommen &amp; Granaten Brown with reddish tinge and just off-white head. Smells sweet and spicy with alcohol notes and wine-like aromas. Very complex. Fruity with some smoke, spices and a rounded, warming finish. Surprisingly drinkable.</p>

<p>Donder &amp; Bliksem Clear golden with very fine streams of carbonation. Large, foamy white head. Lots of flavour; very complex but I couldn‚Äôt pin down the individual bits. Some dry fruitiness, along with some green floweriness and spices.</p>

<p>Engels Golden with a white frothy head. Smells a little hoppy, but not much aroma gets through the head. Clean and crisp with a slight tingle. Lingering finish with herb notes and lemon bitterness.</p>

<p>Hamer &amp; Sikkel Dark brown rather than black. Creamy, with a slightly off-white head. Smells of bitter, chocolatey malt. Quite clean tasting with roast malt and a bitter tingle in the finish. Quite thin in the mouth, but perhaps that‚Äôs to be expected from something that‚Äôs supposed to be a porter.</p>

<p>List &amp; Bedrog Aged in bourbon barrels. Dark brown with a tan head. Smells of bitter, roasted malt with a small amount of alcohol. Not really getting any bourbon. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Very rich with coffee and mocha flavours. Lots of roasted malt and certainly tastes stronger than it smells, but not necessarily as strong as you‚Äôd think from the ABV.</p>

<p>Man &amp; Muis Hazy orangey brown with a very small white head round the edges of the glass. Some blackcurrant type fruit, spice and alcohol notes in the aroma. Thin and flat mouthfeel. Some bitterness, but not a lot of aftertaste. The start is definitely better than the end.</p>

<p>Molenbier Very hazy mid-brown with slightly off-white head. Initial aroma is very sweet with a weird tang, maybe apple. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Initially ok, but very astringent dryness with iron notes that last for ages. Also some vegetable and cranberry notes, and possibly pineapple. Bitter, dry hops dominate after a while.</p>

<p>Single Hop Citra Dark golden with a very slight haze and fine, white head. Smells of grapefruit citrus with a slight mustiness. Not too sharp but there‚Äôs a good undertone of grapefruit. Subtle and refreshing, a very nice session beer.</p>

<p>Sladek Hopburst Hazy orange-brown with bubbles of slightly off-white head that mostly vanishes quickly. Smells very hoppy - noticeable when you open the bottle. Taste is initially hops, mostly bitter with a small amount of citrus. Alcohol notes come through towards the end. Tingly mouthfeel leads to a lingering hop bitterness which continues to tingle on the tongue.</p>

<p>Vuur &amp; Vlam Hazy golden with quite a frothy white head. Smells of American hops and some grapefruit. Tastes similar, with definite grapefruit bitterness and accompanying dryness. It might be a bit of a one-trick pony, but it‚Äôs a pretty impressive trick.</p>

<p>Zomer Hop Hazy dark copper with a large, white, frothy head. Clean, crisp and slightly resinous hops. Taste is similar; clean and hoppy with floral/resin notes and some dryness.</p>

<p>### De Proefbrouwerij</p>

<p>Bloemenbier Frothy white head. Quite pale. Smells of flowers with a bit of citrus. Plenty going on in the mouth. Quite sweet with coriander-like spices and some herbal flavours.</p>

<p>Gageleer Cloudy straw-coloured with a white frothy/bubbly head. Smells of fruit and candy sugar, with some spice aromatics. Smells a lot like roast chicken crisps. Some fizz in the mouth. Lots of spice (cloves/lemon/cardamom/coriander), plus some chalkiness. Some medicinal notes.</p>

<p>Jessenhofke Tripel Slightly hazy golden with some sediment and a small, tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma, just a little alcohol and yeast. Definitely alcoholic, but not a huge amount of taste other than some sweetness. It‚Äôs really all aftertaste and not enough body.</p>

<p>Pr√©aris Blond Hazy golden with a very tight white head. Smells of hop fruitiness and some yeast notes. Quite dry and hoppy with bitterness in the finish. Some bready grain in the middle. Nice, clean and quite distinctive. Pretty good.</p>

<p>Reinaert Grand Cru Brown, with a slightly red hint. Large, frothy white head. Candy sugar, alcohol, and some spice. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Lingering, slightly sweet and tingly aftertaste. Some citrus and dark fruit (sourness) in the main body.</p>

<p>Reinaert Tripel Very cloudy, orange-amber in colour, with a small white head. Candy sugar and a little fruit in the aroma. Hops, spice (black pepper) and some aspirin/carbonated water in the taste. Very much a triple. Long-lasting alcoholic aftertaste.</p>

<p>### De Ranke</p>

<p>Guldenberg Hazy yellow-golden, in fact quite cloudy. Smells clean and slightly hoppy, perhaps some tropical fruit. Very, very fizzy, and not a huge amount of taste, especially considering the ABV. Reminiscent of a light Belgian abbey beer with more fizz and not enough flavour.</p>

<p>Saison de Dottinges Definitely smells like a Saison - funky and sour. Surprisingly clean with biscuity malt and a slight tang. Pretty good.</p>

<p>### De Struise Brouwers</p>

<p>De Struise Wit Hazy, slightly golden with a tight white head.  Smells slightly sweet with some soapiness, although there‚Äôs not a lot going on.  Very slight fizz on the tongue.  Maybe some honey sweetness and a little grassiness.  Really lacking in flavour, but drinkable.</p>

<p>Elliot Brew Copper with a small white head. Very, very astringent with not a whole lot else going on. Really awful.</p>

<p>Shark Pants Purple/red with a very tight, white head and an awesome bottle label. Not overly hopped in the aroma. Plenty of American-style hops in the mouth, well-mixed with some dry resin notes in the finish. Apparently it‚Äôs 300 IBU, which is quite surprising. Doesn‚Äôt taste like it‚Äôs 9%. Very drinkable, rich and smooth, with plenty going on.</p>

<p>Tsjeeses Smells slightly sour. Very dark copper colour with a small, tannish head. Loads of flavour with smoke and alcohol, giving a whisky-cask flavour. Mouthfeel is thick and malty with some sweetness. A pretty unique beer, which would give even the best Christmas beers a run for their money.</p>

<p>Tsjeeses Reserva Hazy dark golden with a white head. Light honey aroma. Taste has lots of spices with pepper, cardomom and ginger. Has a weird, medicinal finish with honey notes, like cheap mead.</p>

<p>### Deeside</p>

<p>LAF Light and quite crisp/drying with some herbal notes. To be honest, it‚Äôs not all that exciting, but it is drinkable.</p>

<p>Macbeth Golden with lots of large bubbles on the sides of the glass and a bubbly white head. Some flowery and bitter hops in the aroma. Taste is dominated by bitter hops. Body is a bit thin, but good, lingering aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Demon Brew</p>

<p>Pacific Kick Golden with bubbly white head. Tropical fruit hop aroma. Fruit and bitterness dominate, with a tingly mouth feel. Quite a lot going on but a bit too bitter dominant.</p>

<p>### Dent</p>

<p>Golden Fleece Golden with malt and some vanilla in the aroma. Some bitter hops and malt. Pretty standard golden ale.</p>

<p>Ramsbottom Chestnut with cream head. Smells fruity and slightly sweet. Well rounded with dried fruit and a good balance of bitterness and sweetness. Clean finish. Drinkable.</p>

<p>### Derby Brewery</p>

<p>Triple Hop Golden with a foamy white head. Smells slightly dirty, but easy-drinking. Somehow it manages to be both complex yet not overly interesting.</p>

<p>### Derventio</p>

<p>Emperor‚Äôs Whim Orangey-golden with no head, but large bubbles of carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some hop bitterness. Clean and drinkable; a good session beer.</p>

<p>### Derwent</p>

<p>Dark Mild Dark, reddish brown with very creamy just off-white head. Roast malt aroma. A hint of bitterness, backed up by dark malt. Solid but uninspiring.</p>

<p>Tommy Legs Copper with tight, creamy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Dry and spicy with some malt to back it up. A great example of a standard bitter.</p>

<p>### Desnoes and Geddes</p>

<p>Dragon Stout Comes in a small (284ml) bottle. Pitch black with some ruby hues and a nice tan head which vanishes almost instantly. Smells of roasted malt with some sweetness. Taste i also malt and sweet, with a creaminess. Finishes with a chocolatey dryness. Could maybe do with a few more hops.</p>

<p>### Devils Backbone</p>

<p>Independence Ale Pale golden with creamy white head. Flowery hop aroma. Smooth and drinkable with a reasonable amount of hop bitterness in the finish. Not a lot else going on though.</p>

<p>### Devils Dyke</p>

<p>Strong Mild Ruby coloured with a frothy head. Smells very alcoholic. Mainly malts, but with an unidentifiable aftertaste, not unpleasant though.</p>

<p>### Devon Earth</p>

<p>Lost in the Woods Dark ruby with a lacy head and chocolate aromas. Slightly fizzy with a mix of smoke, sweet and burnt wood tastes. Some dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Digfield</p>

<p>Fools Nook Pale gold. Smells of citrus hops. Tastes similar with a lingering hop aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Discovery</p>

<p>Dynamite Amber and, other than that, decidedly average.</p>

<p>Pirate‚Äôs Pleasure Pale amber colour. Smells slightly of vegetables/garden. Some fruit taste with a hoppy dryness.</p>

<p>### Dogfish Head</p>

<p>Midas Touch Brewed with saffron. Cloudy orange with good lacing. Smells very complex with honey and some spices. Also some grape-like fruit. Very different but very drinkable. Tastes spicy with alcohol with a light tartness. Well balanced for the ABV.</p>

<p>### Donzoko</p>

<p>Afterglow Very hazy yellow with a pretty large white head. Aroma and taste of tropical fruits with yeast and hops to add balance. Some malt and more juiciness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Dow Bridge</p>

<p>Bonum Mild Dark with no head. Complex, dark and full-flavoured, just as a mild should be. Strong roast malt, full mouthfeel, leading to a very nice finish. [Note: I‚Äôve also had this when it was much less good, a 2 at best.]</p>

<p>Praetorian Porter Very dark, small, foamy off-white head. Smells slightly sour with some burnt notes. Taste is very refreshing, surprisingly so for a porter. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Ratae‚Äôd Amber with a small, off-white head. Smells of sweet malts and fruit, plus some grass. Flavour similar.</p>

<p>Summer Light Light copper in colour. Malty aroma. Some bitterness keeps it drinkable, but really only in the same way that water is drinkable. Definite session beer this one.</p>

<p>### Downton Brewery</p>

<p>Chimera IPA Cloudy bottle conditioned beer. Smells very dodgy, damp carpet/dog with some lemon hints. Taste is better, but isn‚Äôt all that hoppy, which is pretty disappointing.</p>

<p>Quadhop Pale golden with tight white head. Grassy aroma, almost like a lager. Clean and lagery with grain and some nice fruity hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Drygate</p>

<p>Bearface Lager Pale golden with frothy white head that leaves good lacing. Smells grainy with some sweetness and a little hop bitterness, but not a lot. Very clean. not much going on at all though.</p>

<p>Gladeye IPA Golden with tight bubbles of white head. Lots of sharp and bitter hops along with quite a lot of fizz. Surprisingly similar to a Helles with a bit more bite. Refreshing and drinkable.</p>

<p>Orinoco A milk stout. Jet black with a sweet, caramel aroma along with some coffee, roast notes. Medium body with a bit of carbonation. Very well balanced with sweetness, bitterness, roast malt and some alcohol notes.</p>

<p>Outaspace Apple Ale Pale golden with tight white head. Smells slightly fruity. Like a classy version of snakebite. Very clean and drinkable. Nice, bitter finish.</p>

<p>The Missing Piece Hazy orange-golden. Appears to be bottle conditioned although it doesn‚Äôt say so on the label. More aroma than expected with flowery and fruity notes. Quite thin with some bitterness and an odd aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Durham Brewery</p>

<p>Bede‚Äôs Chalice Dark golden colour, with a slight haze. Longish lasting head. Smells distinctly alcoholic. Hoppy, flowery taste, quite fizzy on the tongue. Slightly cloying aftertaste.</p>

<p>White Stout Golden with streams of carbonation and a bubbly, just off-white head. Smells of hops and malt. Quite hoppy and alcoholic. No real resemblance to a stout, much more like a barley wine. Not especially good.</p>

<p>### East London</p>

<p>Vanilla Orchid Mild Very dark with a tan head. Smells of coffee, spice and maybe some vanilla, but that could be a suggestion from the name. Taste is well-rounded with definite coffee notes and a (in my book pleasant) lack of vanilla.</p>

<p>### Ecliptic</p>

<p>Orbiter IPA Orangey golden with a slight haze and a small, white head. Not a huge amount of aroma (I have a cold) but a big hit of hops. Well-balanced with some resin and light tropical fruit notes and a little bitterness in the finish. Definitely a US IPA</p>

<p>### Eden</p>

<p>Clock Brew  Clear copper with no head. Smells bittersweet with some peppery spice. Clean with some malt sweetness and spicy hops in the finish.</p>

<p>Definitely Not The Official Beer Of‚Ä¶ Clear golden, fine streams of carbonation and very little head. Smells sweet and grainy with some hop notes. Clean with some bitterness but not a lot going on.</p>

<p>Seggie Porter Very dark with no carbonation or head. Looks like flat coke. Certainly doesn‚Äôt smell like it though. Lots of dry, roasted notes along with coffee and cocoa. Some fizz in the mouth. Dominated by dry, roasted malt with a bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>The 19th Brew Pale golden with small head. Citrus hops in aroma and taste. Clean and refreshing. Excellent session beer.</p>

<p>### Eden Mill</p>

<p>Bourbon Barrel Dark chestnut brown. Aroma has coffee, sweetness, dark fruit. Quite sweet, some alcohol notes, not a huge amount going on other than that. Can‚Äôt really get any oak.</p>

<p>Chilli and Ginger Porter Black with no head (was explosive out of the bottle though). Chocolate, chilli and ginger in the aroma, among with some roast malts. Loads of spice (ginger and chili), with a lingering, warming finish.</p>

<p>Mini Golf GPA Golden with small white head. Malty aroma. Very clean and drinkable with some fruit notes and zesty hops. Wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs low ABV.</p>

<p>### Edge</p>

<p>Franklins Ale Dark copper, small, quickly-thinning white head with lots of lacing. Smells very malty with some caramel sweetness. Slight vegetable taste with a slight skunkiness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Edinbrew</p>

<p>85 Shilling Very dark red with an off-white head. Lots of malt and some oats in the aroma. Smooth and creamy with a light bitterness in the finish. Certainly drinkable.</p>

<p>Citra Pale Golden with a small white head. Light aroma with some citrus. It‚Äôs pretty thin with some grassy notes.</p>

<p>Super Stout Jet black with creamy white head. Light roasted and bitter aroma. Very, very smooth mouthfeel. Some bitterness in the mouthfeel. A worryingly drinkable stout.</p>

<p>### Edinburgh Beer Factory</p>

<p>Bunk! #1 Very dark with reddish hues and a lacy off-white head. Robust American hops in the aroma and taste. Lots of resinous, dry hops flavour, especially in the finish.</p>

<p>Bunk! #2 Smoky Wheat Clear golden with tight, long-lasting white head. Weissbier aroma with spices and a hint of smoke. Smoke in the taste is quite subtle, but definitely there and works well. Taste also has the usual banana and clove spice notes.</p>

<p>Paolozzi In short, it‚Äôs a lager. Clear golden with lots of carbonation and a fluffy white head. Clean and doesn‚Äôt really taste of a huge amount. Some malt and sweetness.</p>

<p>### Eem</p>

<p>Dark Saison Dark brown with small tan head that leaves good lacing. Spice and roasted malt. Very lingering dry and malty finish. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Elav</p>

<p>Belfast Blue Bitter Very dark brown with red hues. Small froth of tan head. Smells slightly skunky with resinous hop notes. Quite thin, with some US-style hops and a little bitter-sweet finish. OK, but wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere near a great british bitter.</p>

<p>Grunge IPA Dark copper, slightly hazy with an off-white head. Smells of slightly musty, resinous hops. Lots of hop bitterness with some roast and smoke notes in the mouth. A very nice American-style IPA.</p>

<p>### Elixir</p>

<p>Freemantle Doctor Golden with bubbly white head.  Nice aroma of flowery hops. Quite a lot of fizz in the mouth. Very clean hop taste leading to a drying, grapefruit-like finish that lingers. Well-balanced and very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Elland</p>

<p>Nettlethrasher Copper, with a foamy head. Smells malty. Very rounded taste with some hoppy dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Emersons</p>

<p>1812 Golden orange. Loads of tropical and bitter hops in the aroma. Quite fizzy. Clean tasting with similar hops to the aroma, but not as much as you‚Äôd expect.</p>

<p>Bookbinder It‚Äôs a malty, standard bitter. Couldn‚Äôt really be more average.</p>

<p>Pilsner It‚Äôs essentials Carling‚Ä¶</p>

<p>### Ennerdale Darkest</p>

<p>Whitehaven I‚Äôm not sure what `darkestst‚Äô applies to - it‚Äôs certainly not the colour. Mid-brown with a small white head. Bitter and hoppy, with a balancing sweetness and a good malt body. Not a bad beer at all, but not really outstanding in any way.</p>

<p>### Enville</p>

<p>Ginger Beer Bright golden in colour, smells strongly of ginger. Very sweet, and nothing other than ginger going on. May be good if you don‚Äôt actually like beer.</p>

<p>### Epic</p>

<p>House of Nicholas Sarah Golden with small white head. Not a lot of aroma. Fizzy mouthfeel. Some white wine notes. Pretty drinkable but uninspiring.</p>

<p>### Erdinger</p>

<p>Erdinger Alkoholfrei (blue) A beer which shows that alcohol free beers aren‚Äôt all bad. Hazy golden with large, white head. Smells of malt with much more sweetness than you‚Äôd expect from a weissbier. None of the standard banana notes. Taste is also sweet and malty, so it‚Äôs not a great weissbier, but not a bad beer in general.</p>

<p>Erdinger Pikantus A book weissbier. Dark hazy copper, with a standard weissbier head. Aroma is banana and spice with some sweetness. Nice big flavour, with caramel malls and some dark fruit. Good mouthfeel, with mild carbonation, manages to disguise the ABV well.</p>

<p>Erdinger Schneeweise Looks like weissbier, with a large frothy white head. Quite fizzy. Cleanish mouthfeel, with a little spice and hoppy bitterness cutting through the normal wheatiness. No real lemon thought.</p>

<p>Erdinger Schneeweise Looks like weissbier, with a large frothy white head. Quite fizzy. Cleanish mouthfeel, with a little spice and hoppy bitterness cutting through the normal wheatiness. No real lemon thought.</p>

<p>Erdinger Urweisse Hazy orange-gold with typical weissbier head. Aroma has a little sweetness with banana and wheat bread. Smooth tasting with some esters and a light spiciness. Quite a filling weissbier.</p>

<p>Erdinger Weissbier Golden coloured with plenty of carbonation. Largish head which dies quite quickly. Smells slightly fruity with some banana and bubblegum. Quite mild taste, mostly wheat and a little tang. Drinkable but not overly exciting.</p>

<p>Erdinger Weissbier Dunkel Dark brown with a thick white head. No real lacing once the head vanishes. Smell isn‚Äôt ovally exciting, maybe some dark fruits. Some sweetness and roasted malts in the taste, very fizzy. More interesting than the normal weissbier, but still not brilliant.</p>

<p>Hefeweis Oktoberfest Cloudy, mid golden with a smallish white, frothy head. Suspect there would be more head on a full glass. Some flowery hops, and a little banana. Predominantly just very fizzy.</p>

<p>### Evan Evans</p>

<p>Full Cry Dark copper with a white, froth of head Smells slightly fruity with some banana and hop notes; much like a weissbier. Some whisky in the flavour. Nice full body and very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Everard‚Äôs</p>

<p>Beacon Clear golden-amber with a surprising amount of carbonation. Smells of hops with some biscuit malt undertones. Tastes similar to the smell, finishes quite dry. Nice session beer.</p>

<p>Everard‚Äôs Original Mid brown, bubbles of white head. Very malty, some rich sweetness. Lots of aroma, some nuttiness follows initial burnt notes. Nutty malt in the taste with some fizz on the tongue. Slightly sticky, sweet mouthfeel.</p>

<p>Sunchaser Pale gold with a thin white head. Not a huge amount of aroma, some faint bitterness. Tangy hops with some sweetness. Pretty well balanced and would probably appeal to lager drinkers.</p>

<p>Tiger Orange with a slight red tinge, white head. Smells slightly of toffee and caramel, with malt. No real hop. Tastes reasonably sweet with plenty of malt. Easy to drink; good session beer.</p>

<p>Whakatu Slightly cloudy, pale blonde/golden with a creamy white head. Smells somewhat vinegary. Tastes of light malt with citrus (grapefruit) hoppy bitterness. Drinkable, but a bit dull to be anything other than a session beer.</p>

<p>### Fallen Brewery</p>

<p>Blackhouse Smoked porter. Very dark with reddish tinges and foamy, off-white head. A little smoke in the aroma and taste, but not overpowering. Smooth and very drinkable. More like a mild.</p>

<p>Dragonfly Hazy dark brown. Slightly fruity hop aroma. Good hit of bitter, fruit and resinous hops. Very clean and drinkable, with a nice tingle in the mouth.</p>

<p>Grapevine Slightly cloudy orange. Grass, pine and plenty of hops in the aroma. Lots of tropical fruit, citrus and general hoppiness in the mouth. Easy to drink and a nice, dry finish.</p>

<p>Light Freight Table beer. Slightly hazy golden (bottle conditioned and been carried around). Tropical fruit hop aroma. Taste is very similar. Clean and very drinkable with fruity hops dominating. Quite light, but doesn‚Äôt miss the ABV. Would be a very good summer session beer.</p>

<p>Local Motive Dark copper with plenty of hops in the aroma. Fruity, flowery and bitter hops well balanced. Very nice session IPA.</p>

<p>### Farringdon</p>

<p>Black Swan Mild Very dark ruby in colour. Aroma is all dark fruits. Taste is odd, with lots of burnt notes leading to a bitter aftertaste. Disappointing.</p>

<p>### Feldschlosschen</p>

<p>Cardinal Pale golden with creamy white head. Lots of lacing. Smells mostly of malt, and the taste is similar. Quite average, but good after a day‚Äôs snowbaording.</p>

<p>Cardinal Almost identical to the bottled version.</p>

<p>Feldschl√∂sschen Original Pale golden with bubbly head. Not a huge amount of aroma, mostly malt. Tastes like a lager, although there‚Äôs some metallic notes. Easy to drink, but very dull and a bit too fizzy.</p>

<p>Gurten Golden in colour, with good lacing. Grassy aroma. Tastes very watery, although it could have been a lot worse. OK, I copied the review for Valaisanne, but to be honest I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference. Quite why they make so many of the same beers is beyond me.</p>

<p>Valaisanne Golden in colour, with good lacing. Grassy aroma. Tastes very watery, although it could have been a lot worse.</p>

<p>### Felinfoel</p>

<p>Double Dragon Dark copper, creamy white head. Smells sweet and malty. Very full mouthfeel with malts, a little sweetness and very faint hop bitterness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Fell Brewery</p>

<p>Pizmo Hazy golden with a tight, creamy white head. Some bitterness and fruits in the aroma. Taste is similar, with a bit of a bite and tropical notes in the finish.</p>

<p>### Ferry Brewery</p>

<p>Three Bridges Dark golden with creamy white head. Not a huge amount going on in the aroma or taste. A little bitterness in the finish. Generic but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>### Fierce</p>

<p>Day Shift Golden with very sticky white head. Some resinous and fruity hops in the aroma. Less hoppy than I was expecting from the description, but still loads going on. Bitterness, resin and fruit notes. Also quite drying in the finish. Easy to drink but with lots of interesting things going on. Perhaps a little muddled, but otherwise hard to criticise.</p>

<p>Moose Mousse Chocolate milk stout. Jet black with almost no head - what‚Äôs there is definitely on the brown side of tan. Lots of chocolate aroma. Very smooth (almost velvety) with huge amounts of chocolate and a light, lingering bitterness. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Night Shift Very dark with no head. Light aroma of tropical hops and some roasted notes. Taste has a balance of bitter hops leading though to some tropical fruit notes in the finish. Quite interesting.</p>

<p>Tangerine Tart Golden with large bubbles on the side of the glass, but no head. Smells of orange/tangerine with some sweetness. Clean taste with some citrus notes and a surprising, sour finish. Pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>### First Chop</p>

<p>Ava Described as a beautiful hoppy blonde (also gluten free). A very good description. Clean, fresh, interesting balance of hops. Would have no idea it‚Äôs GF</p>

<p>Hop Grain with some light citrus hops in the aroma. Initially a bit grainy and sweet but then some US-style hops and then a drying finish. Not bad at all.</p>

<p>SYL Very dark brown with red hues and a very lively off-white head. Spicy hop and chocolate, roasted malt aroma. Tingly mouthfeel with slightly astringent bitterness, resin hops, and herbal notes. Very interesting black IPA and certainly not obviously gluten free.</p>

<p>### Fischer Brau</p>

<p>Fischer Helles Clear golden with not much carbonation. Smells quite sweet, with a slightly off-putting vegetablyness. Taste is quite sweet and clean, but there‚Äôs not a lot going on. Not as good as an Augustiner, for example.</p>

<p>### Five Points</p>

<p>Five Points Pale Pale golden with tight white head. Citrus and malt aroma. Taste is similar. Pretty standard pale ale.</p>

<p>### Five Towns</p>

<p>Davy Jones Locker Dark coloured. Smells quite hoppy. Very nice, clean and drinkable, with enough going on to keep it interesting as a session beer.</p>

<p>### Flensburger Brauerei</p>

<p>Flensburger Gold As the name suggests, golden in colour. Has a slightly sweet floral aroma. Tingly, but not too fizzy, mouthfeel. Sweeter than a lot of German lagers, with a little hop bitterness.</p>

<p>### Flying Dog</p>

<p>Dog Schwarz Jet black, opaque with a quickly-vanishing tan head. Smells smokey, with not a lot else going on. Initially fizzy mouthfeel leads to a rich, slightly tingly finish. Taste is all smoke and oak, but not overpoweringly so.</p>

<p>Doggie Style Copper coloured, not a huge amount of head and no carbonation. Smells of floral and citrus hops; I suspect it‚Äôs dry hopped. Nice initial taste, with lots of citrus hops but not too much bitterness. A little thin in the mouth, but a nice lingering, dry finish.</p>

<p>Dogtoberfest Dark copper, with a small white frothy head. Smells caramel sweet. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel with sweetness followed by a strange bitterness. Really not what I was expecting. Odd.</p>

<p>Doubledog IPA Light copper, tight white head. Lots of hops in the aroma, also some dirty vegetable notes. Lots of hops in the mouth as well. Very strong bitterness on the edge of the tongue. Melon/pineapple fruitiness mixes well with the hops.</p>

<p>Gonzo Imperial Porter Incredibly fizzy, in fact it explodes out of the glass. Dark brown with a tan head. Smells quite sweet. Fizzy mouthfeel. Tastes slightly burnt and the alcohol notes are too strong.</p>

<p>Horn Dog Golden and hazy. Very small, slick white head. Smells of fruit and caramel, with banana notes. Quite strong, with alcohol burn and dryness. Syrupy mouthfeel. Taste is dark fruit and a lot of alcohol. Some dry hops with a little bitterness in the finish. A bit too sickly.</p>

<p>International Arms Race (Zero IBU IPA.) Hazy golden with very little head. Had at a beer tasting, with two very different results. One smells of smoke and yeast, the other of grapefruit with slight vinegar notes; cloudier ones smell smokier. Cloudy one has yeast and marmite in the taste, whilst the clearer one has grapefruit citrus and bitterness. Oddly, not as good as either when they are mixed. Some sweetness builds throughout.</p>

<p>K9 Golden colour with a very thin white head. Smells strong and has a fizzy mouthfeel. There‚Äôs a surprising amount of hops with some light malt, giving a nice level of sweetness. Quite clean and refreshing; doesn‚Äôt really seem like a Christmas beer at all.</p>

<p>Kujo Imperial Coffee Stout Pours black and oily. Smells of roasted coffee. Serious coffee taste that lingers into a creamy finish. Doesn‚Äôt taste anything at all like the ABV. A very nice stout; would be interesting to see how it ages.</p>

<p>Old Scratch Amber Lager Slightly hazy copper colour with an odd-white head. Some hops, although not a lot of aroma. A little citrus in the taste, with some hop bitterness with a slightly dry finish.</p>

<p>Pearl Necklace Oyster Stout Dark brown rather than the black I‚Äôd expected. Good tan head. Smells of roasted malts, with a touch of salty brine. Smooth and drinkable. Taste has light roasted malts with a good bitterness and then a minerally finish. Slight oilyness in the mouth.</p>

<p>Raging Bitch Copper coloured, very thin white head. Aroma is all hops. Slightly tingly mouthfeel. Taste is also all hops, with a good mix of floral notes and bitterness. Has a lingering dry finish.</p>

<p>Snake Dog IPA Golden in colour, with a small, frothy white head. Smells of hops, both bitter and floral, along with a little citrus. Quite highly carbonated. Some grass, bitterness, citrus and a bit of malt. Very dry, lingering finish, One for the bitter-hop lover.</p>

<p>Wild Dog Barrel-aged Gonzo Imperial Porter. Pours jet black and oily with a tan head. Smoke and whisky notes in the aroma, along with some sweetness and alcohol. Smooth mouthfeel, very rich with roasted malts and port flavours. Some bitterness and coffee in the finish. Stickiness builds after a while, but it‚Äôs not actually very sweet. Very, very tasty.</p>

<p>WildEman Bright golden with marshmallow foam of white head. Some sour noted and hops in the aroma. Clean with some bitterness and alcohol in the taste. Very drinkable; seems like a cross between a saison/weissbier and an IPA.</p>

<p>Woody Creek White Hazy light golden with a tight, thick white head. Smells like a wit. Tastes like nice, clean, light one. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Fordham Brewing Company</p>

<p>Copperhead Ale Light malty and sweet aroma, reminiscent of an alt. Hazy copper, with a thin, just off-white head. Taste is slightly bitter with some grain notes an a nice hoppy finish.</p>

<p>Tavern Ale Hazy golden with a white head. Smells of dirty, resinous hops and malt. Some fizz in the mouth, and the flavour is dominated by resinous hops and a dry finish. Definitely American; don‚Äôt expect a British style ale.</p>

<p>Wisteria Wheat Hazy golden. Lots of banana, wheat and clove in the aroma. Very much like a rich, bananary German weissbier. Very nice, but perhaps a little too sweet to have more than one or two.</p>

<p>### Forge</p>

<p>Forge IPA Light golden with a fake lemon aroma. Mouthfeel is very thin, with more lemon hops and a bit of malt. OK.</p>

<p>### Fort Cerveza</p>

<p>Oatmeal Porter Very dark with creamy off-white head. Roasted notes in the aroma. Quite bitter initially with a building roast finish. Overall pretty smooth and interesting.</p>

<p>### Founders</p>

<p>106 Pale golden. Grassy and grain notes in the aroma. Very clean and drinkable - much like a pilsner.</p>

<p>1981 Golden with bubbly white head. Smells of grassy hops with some sweetness. Very clean and drinkable, but nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>2009 Dark golden. Not a huge amount of aroma. Quite fruity. More of a classic IPA than an overly hopped one. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Founders Brewing Company</p>

<p>All Day IPA Dark golden with a very slightly off-white head. Smells of grapefruit and orange citrus hops, with some hints of mango. Refreshing and clean tasting with a nice tingle in the mouth. A little grapefruit bitterness in the finish. A very nice American IPA, which is remarkably civilised and easy-drinking.</p>

<p>Centenial IPA Mid golden with a tight white head. Slightly dirty aroma with a bit of malt. Taste is also malty, with a very full mouthfeel. Some sweetness and drying hops in the finish. Gets quite sticky. Boring and somewhat overly alcoholic.</p>

<p>Dirty Bastard Reddish copper with a very small white head. Dry chocolate malt and cocoa in the aroma. Malty taste, with a bit of dark fruit. Somewhat reminiscent of malt loaf. Some rum notes in the finish.</p>

<p>### Fourpure</p>

<p>Juicebox Pint can. Hazy dark golden with sticky white head. Huge amount of hop aroma, both citrus and resin. Taste is similar - definitely a US style IPA. Nothing subtle, but very flavourful and drinkable. Nice bitterness and tingle in the finish.</p>

<p>Session IPA From a can, so no idea of colour or head. Lots of bitter, citrus hops in the aroma. Taste is very clean with some bitter hops. Not a blow your head off American style IPA, but very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Fownes</p>

<p>Storyteller Light golden. Smell and taste are both very crisp and clean, leading to a very drinkable, if somewhat anonymous beer.</p>

<p>### Franciscan Wells</p>

<p>Rebel Red Dark red with small, just off-white head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Taste is similar. Really quite sweet. OK.</p>

<p>### Franken Brau Lorenz Bauer</p>

<p>Franken Br√§u Pilsner Golden with a bubbly white head. Smells like a pilsner with a slight sweetness and grain notes. Not too much fizz in the mouth, but also not that much taste. Clean and drinkable with a slightly dry finish.</p>

<p>### Frederic Robinson Ltd</p>

<p>Chocolate Tom Reddy brown with a chocolate aroma which carries on in the taste. Quite dry with a bitter finish. A bit weird, but I‚Äôm not that keen on chocolate.</p>

<p>Ginger Tom Very dark brown, with only a little head at the side of the glass. Smells of ginger nut biscuits with a little lemon. Thin mouthfeel, some tingle. Taste is a little dark fruit, with the ginger being relegated to the aftertaste. It‚Äôs a blend of Old Tom and Fentiman‚Äôs Ginger Beer, and is as confused as that makes it sound.</p>

<p>Old Tom Burgundy colour, with little head. Smells of alcohol, with some dark fruit notes. Quite well balanced with some sweetness and a hint of background bitterness. Full in the mouth with medium carbonation. Drinkable, especially for a barley wine.</p>

<p>### Freedom</p>

<p>Freedom Stout Jet black, no fizz and a very creamy white head. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, although quite creamy. Heavy malt with some roasted flavours. Very much like Guinness actually.</p>

<p>### Freja</p>

<p>Valkyrie Dark golden with patchy white head that leaves good lacing. Resin and fruity hops in both the aroma and taste. Good, bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Frog Island</p>

<p>Frog Island Bitter Quite pale. Large, creamy head with an initally bitter taste, balanced nicely by a long refreshing aftertaste. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Front Row</p>

<p>Sin Bin Light golden. Smell and taste are both very crisp and clean, with slight hopping in both. A good summer session beer.</p>

<p>### Full Mash</p>

<p>Pickwick Porter Dark coloured. Smells of roasted malt. Full and smooth mouthfeel with a good balance of roast malt and bitterness. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Fuller Smith and Turner</p>

<p>Bengal Lancer Clear orange with frothy white head. Smells of spicy hops with malt and some caramel sweetness. Also some apple/pear fruit. Initial taste has good spicy hop bitterness and zesty fruit. Quite a sharp mouthfeel, but definitely a quaffable beer.</p>

<p>Black Cab Dark brown with very little head. Smells of coffee, with well-roasted malt and some sweetness. Nicely full mouthfeel, with plenty of roasted malt and coffee. Not too much carbonation makes this a very drinkable stout. Builds to a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>Fuller Smith and Turner 1845 Copper coloured with a white frothy head. Smells fruity with sweet malt. Taste is full with malt backed up by fruit and just enough bitterness. Well balanced but doesn‚Äôt really do anything out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Fuller Smith and Turner Discovery Golden amber with a foamy white head. Aroma is fruity with floral hops. Taste is very watery. Good if you want something with a low ABV, otherwise best avoided.</p>

<p>Fuller Smith and Turner ESB Clear, mahogany colour. Very malty, with a clean hop aroma. Very full, almost chewy mouthfeel with woody notes and some dry hop notes. A little sweetness. Finish is slightly sharp with a hop kick. This is a seriously good strong bitter and could be a dangerously drinkable session ale.</p>

<p>Fuller Smith and Turner Front Row Golden with very little head. Thin and watery. Very boring but nothing really wrong with it. Very slight hoppiness in the finish.</p>

<p>Fuller Smith and Turner London Porter Almost opaque dark brown, almost black. Smells very malty with hints of coffee and chocolate, along with some molasses sweetness. Initial flavour is chocolately, backed up by plenty of roasted malts. Very smooth and well-rounded. Dry finish with a lingering smokey flavour.</p>

<p>Fuller Smith and Turner London Pride Smells slightly caramelly, with a touch of malt. Also something chemical about it. Almost a smoothflow head. Very uninteresting. I‚Äôve had this in London (this one was in the Midlands) and it was much better.</p>

<p>Golden Pride Coppery-gold colour, with a long-lasting, small, tan head. Smells rich and fruity, with a little hoppy bitterness. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, rounded sweetish malts and some lingering hop bitterness. Strong alcoholic notes, as would be expected from the ABV. Definitely not a quaffing beer, perhaps a little too strong.</p>

<p>Seafarers Ale Amber in colour with little head. Smells of bready malt, with some sweetness and nuts. Taste is mostly hops, with spice, citrus and bitterness. Medium bodied and very drinkable. A good beer.</p>

<p>Spring Sprinter Golden with bubbly white head. Smells of gooseberry? / tropical fruit with some malt. Quite sweet with malt do dominant and some tropical fruit. Decent, if a little uninspiring.</p>

<p>### Furstlich Furstenbergische Brauerei</p>

<p>Edel Export Clean, bright golden. Smells quite sweet and malty.  Taste is similar, but balanced by hop bitterness. Refreshing and not too sweet.</p>

<p>F√ºrstenberg Export Oddly, despite this being an export, I‚Äôve only ever seen it in Germany. Although it‚Äôs the same ABV as the normal version, it‚Äôs significantly more drinkable. Standard golden colour with slightly sweet nose. Taste is lager with pale malt and a slightly citrusy finish. Not bad for a lager, but not great for a German lager.</p>

<p>F√ºrstenberg Premium Lager Golden, smells like an average lager; tastes like one too. Nothing to see here, certainly nothing premium about it.</p>

<p>### Fuzzy Duck</p>

<p>Tangerine Duck Orange-amber in colour, with some sweetness and a little marmalade. Finish is a little bitter.</p>

<p>### Fyne Ales</p>

<p>Avalanche Very blonde, with a citrus/hoppy aroma. Clean and refreshing with some bitterness throughout. Lingering aftertaste, but could do with a bit more body. Good summer beer and definitely drinkable.</p>

<p>Highlander Light copper colour with a finger of tight white head. Some fruit and hop in the aroma. Quite sweet with malt and some dryness. Quite nice, but perhaps a bit too thin.</p>

<p>Jarl Yellow with a large, frothy white head. Aroma of bitter, citrus hops. Lemon in the mouth as well, with a nice lingering citrus finish. Very clean and drinkable.</p>

<p>Piper‚Äôs Gold Golden with no real head. Some malt in the aroma. Nice bitterness with some sweetness and perhaps a few spicy hops.</p>

<p>Sanda Black Interestingly mixed aroma with roasted malt and citrus fruit. Well-balanced and interesting, definitely dark notes along with an IPA bitterness and hops.</p>

<p>Sanda Blonde Smells surprisingly sweet. Very clean with citrus fruit leading to a lingering bitterness. Very drinkable with plenty going on to keep it interesting. Should come in bigger bottles!</p>

<p>Vital Spark Dark brown with a thin head that vanishes quickly. Smells of dark fruit, roasted malt, and there‚Äôs some bitterness. Taste is similar, with nutty overtones and some juicy, berry. Fairly spicy finish.</p>

<p>### Gadds</p>

<p>Dragon Blood Light in colour with a creamy head. Malty but with a strong vanilla and caramel taste.</p>

<p>### Galbraith‚Äôs</p>

<p>Bellringer‚Äôs Best Bitter Copper with small white head. Some fruit and a touch of bitterness. Low carbonation. Very quaffable.</p>

<p>Grafton Porter Very dark with creamy head. Roast malts in the aroma. Very smooth with roast flavours to start followed by a good level of bitterness to keep it interesting. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Lager
 Pale golden with very little head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Taste is similar; very clean with a tingle and a touch of bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>NZPA Golden with small white head. Tropical fruit notes. Pineapple and mango in the taste. A little bitterness too. Very well balanced and clean with a tingly mouthfeel.</p>

<p>Pilsner
 Pale golden with white head. Clean and drinkable with light malt notes, a little sweetness and some light fruit.</p>

<p>Santana Golden with small head. Tropical fruits with resinous hops and definite alcohol. Tastes quite like fruit sweets.</p>

<p>### Gallus Brewing</p>

<p>Pale Ale Slightly hazy golden with large bubbles. Tropical fruit in the aroma. Lots of fizz in the mouth. More tropical fruit, which mixes with alcohol notes in the finish. Nice but a bit too fizzy.</p>

<p>### Gamla Slottskallans Bryggeri</p>

<p>Slottsk√§llans Imperial Stout Black with a tan head that fades quickly to a little lacing. Smells of burnt malt with some sweet cocoa and a bit of sourness. Mouthfeel is fizzy; probably too much carbonation. Tastes of roasted coffee and alcohol.</p>

<p>### Geltsdale</p>

<p>Brampton Bitter Very cloudy with small head. Some light bitter hops in the taste and aroma. Dull.</p>

<p>Cold Fell Pale golden with tight white head. Smells crisp and clean. Tastes similar, clean and refreshing but not a lot going on.</p>

<p>### Gemstone</p>

<p>Emerald Golden in colour. Aroma had fruity hops. A bit green but has a reasonable balance of malt and hops and is generally quite nice.</p>

<p>### Gidley‚Äôs</p>

<p>Meadow Golden amber with no head. Slightly hoppy aroma with an accompanying bitter taste. A bit bland, good session beer.</p>

<p>### Gipsy Hill</p>

<p>Percolator Deep brown with thin white head. Huge roasted aroma. Flavour is all coffee with some creaminess (from the oats?). Could easily be mistaken for a coffee stout - it‚Äôs good to have more brown ales around though.</p>

<p>### Glastonbury</p>

<p>Hedgemonkey A dark malty bitter with roasted flavour dominating. A bit thin and lacking in a finish.</p>

<p>Love Monkey Clear copper. Taste and smell are both flowery. A nice summer beer with not too much carbonation.</p>

<p>Mystery Tor Golden colour with very little head (although it was poured into a paper cup in a field, so your milage may vary). Aroma is heavy on the floral hops. Taste is excellent with an initial sweetness turning into heavy hop bitterness which lingers. Nice and crisp, a very good summer session beer.</p>

<p>Pilton Pop Brown. Taste is mildly bitter but not really very exciting. Tastes slightly mass produced.</p>

<p>Summer Solstice Light golden, with a creamy head. Smells of pale malt. Palate is light, with some sweetness, fruit and flowery hops.</p>

<p>### Glebe Farm</p>

<p>Gladiator Spelt Beer Very grainy smell, slightly hazy amber-orange with no head. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, quite refreshing and interesting with enough hops to balance the grain.</p>

<p>### Gloucester Brewing</p>

<p>Citra Golden with small white head. Loads of grapefruit hops in the aroma. Clean and slightly bitter with grapefruit notes and a nice, lingering dryness.</p>

<p>### Goddards</p>

<p>Ale of Wight Slightly hazy golden with large, tight bubbles of white head. Zesty citrus hops in the aroma. Lots of spicy, bitter hops. Clean and drinkable with a lemony finish.</p>

<p>Fuggle-Dee-Dum Dark copper with very tight white head. Smells very rich. Full bodied and slightly sweet with malt and a bit of spice.</p>

<p>Scrumdiggity Copper with little head. Slightly thin and sweet with definite homebrew notes. However, it‚Äôs pretty drinkable despite the vegetably undertones.</p>

<p>### Goffs</p>

<p>Jouster Clear copper with a small white head. Not a lot of aroma, perhaps some malt and a little spicy hop. Taste has some caramel with pale, biscuity malt and some dry hops in the aftertaste. Drinkable but a bit unexciting.</p>

<p>White Knight Orangey-golden and a little hazy. Smells slightly of fruity hops with some slightly odd burnt notes. Very refreshing with some malt and good hopping. Pretty good.</p>

<p>### Golden Eagle</p>

<p>Original Vienna Lager Copper with patchy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Dominated by malt, nuttiness, and a fizzy mouthfeel. Brown ale like.</p>

<p>### Golden Valley</p>

<p>Kenyon Oatmeal Stout Black with a slightly oily head. Little aroma. Some roasted malts with a lot of dryness in the aftertaste and some lingering alcohol notes.</p>

<p>### Good George</p>

<p>Southfarthing Stout Exclusive to the Green Dragon in Hobbiton. Served in beakers so no idea of colour - presume it‚Äôs dark. Tan head. Roasted malt and some sweetness in the aroma. Very smooth and drinkable with a good bitterness to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>### Good George Brewing</p>

<p>Girdley Southfarthing Fine Grain Served in a beaker at the Green Dragon Inn in Hobbiton so no idea of colour. Large white head. Not too fizzy with a reasonable balance of sweetness and malt.</p>

<p>### Goose Island</p>

<p>Goose Island 312 Very pale. Smells of yeast, wheat and a little light malt. Little head. Has a fizzy mouthfeel. Quite a light taste, some citrus, a little sweetness and some spice.</p>

<p>Goose Island India Pale Ale Amber with a patchy white head. Smells of flowery hops with a little alcohol. Taste is mostly hops, with a good bitterness followed by sweet malt. Quite an oily finish.</p>

<p>Honker‚Äôs Ale First sight and smell is very reminiscent of an English bitter, so good work on that part. Malty, with a tang of fruit, both of which continue through a long-lasting finish. Also has an almost nutty flavour. Solid and drinkable.</p>

<p>Summertime Clear golden with very little head. Smells malty and sweet. Tingly and clean-tasting with a little bitterness. Good summer beer, but not overly exciting.</p>

<p>### Grain</p>

<p>India Pale Ale Golden with a froth of white head. Smells of American style hops with resinous notes. Smooth, with a bitter finish, which lingers well. A good take on a US-style IPA.</p>

<p>### Granite Rock</p>

<p>Bronscombe‚Äôs Vision  Deep brown colour. Smells malty with dark fruit. Taste is dominated by bitterness with some fruit. Finish is distinctive - almonds or marzipan?</p>

<p>### Great Divide Brewing Company</p>

<p>Hercules Double IPA Reddy brown, with a thin, frothy tan head. Smells of floral hops and liquorice. Very complex, with a nice mix of malt, hops and some spice.</p>

<p>Titan IPA Bright copper with a foamy white head. Smells of resinous/pine hops with some floweriness and citrus notes. Initial taste is a huge burst of hops, not just bitterness but a whole load going on. Eventually kind-of balanced by the malts, but then moves through to a bitter hop finish.</p>

<p>Yeti Imperial Stout Jet black with a tan head. Smells burnt with treacle notes. Viscous with liquorice and lots of roasted malt in the taste. Some alcohol and coffee notes in the finish. Feels very heavy, with a drying powdery finish, reminiscent of cocoa powder.</p>

<p>### Great Heck</p>

<p>Black Jesus Jet black with foamy just-off-white head. Spicy hop aroma with hints of dark malt. Definitely a US-style IPA with loads of resinous hops and some bitterness. Not massively well balanced.</p>

<p>### Green Flash</p>

<p>Double Stout Pitch black, with small bubbles of tan head. Lots of roasted malt and some alcohol in the nose, along with coffee sweetness. Very fizzy. Lots of bitterness and roasted coffee, especially in the finish. Also some alcohol notes. Very strongly flavours, perhaps too bitter. Becomes oddly flowery as it warms up.</p>

<p>West Coast IPA Slightly hazy copper with no real head. Smells like you‚Äôd expect from an American IPA, with a big hop hit. Seriously interesting mix of hops in the taste. Well balanced, with a nice, lingering finish that manages to not be overpowering.</p>

<p>### Green Jack</p>

<p>Lurcher Stout Some fruit aroma. Black with a long lasting, frothy head. Tastes of dark fruits, with some fizz in the mouthfeel. A little hoppy bitterness mixed with coffee. Quite complicated with a dry finish.</p>

<p>Trawlerboys Copper coloured with a tight, creamy white head. Good lacing. Smells slightly fruity, has a fizzy mouthfeel with an almost sweet note. Disappointing.</p>

<p>### Greene King</p>

<p>Abbot Ale Clear amber ale with a thick white head. Smells lightly go caramel, with perhaps some fruit. Very smooth, almost like a smoothflow bitter. Hops, caramel and malt, but not overly well balanced.</p>

<p>Greene King IPA Clear amber beer, with an almost smoothflow head. Very mild smell, no sign of the expected IPA hoppiness. Similar in taste, although it does have a slight dryness. Average IPA.</p>

<p>Greene King IPA Gold Clear golden with a slightly off-white head. Smells and tastes of clean citrus hopes with a little bitterness in the finish. A good session beer, but nothing overly exciting going on.</p>

<p>Hen‚Äôs Tooth Orange with a frothy head. Smells light with grain and a bit of citrus, maybe orange. Smooth mouthfeel, with lightly toasted malt and some spice. Quite buttery. Also some yeast from the bottle conditioning.</p>

<p>Hop Smells of hops and citrus. Surprising taste, not at all what I was expecting; quite spicy with a dryness and some fruit. OK, but overly complicated.</p>

<p>Old Crafty Hen Smells exactly like the Old Speckled Hen (in fact, it‚Äôs a blend of that and the 5X), some vegetablyness. Dark copper with very little head. Slightly tingly mouthfeel, some dark roasted malts and a little burnt caramel. A bit too strong for the body.</p>

<p>Old Golden Hen Pale golden with a few streams of carbonation and a couple of patches of white head. Smells of clean hops with some tropical fruit notes. Quite fizzy mouthfeel. Taste it malt and fruity hops leading to a sweet, peach-like finish.</p>

<p>Old Speckled Hen Pale copper, with a slight malt and caramel/fruit smell. Tastes rich and somewhat creamy, with a malty and slightly alcoholic aftertaste.</p>

<p>Old Suffolk English A blend of a couple of beers. Clear caramel colour with bubbly head. Smells of toffee with some vanilla and dark fruits. Quite smooth with lots of malt. Not very much hops, but does have a herby finish.</p>

<p>Ridley‚Äôs Old Bob Amber with a thick white head. Aroma is dried fruit and malt, with some dark sugar notes. Just what you‚Äôd expect from an ESB. Taste is sweet caramel, and there‚Äôs quite a lot of fizz.</p>

<p>Ruddles Best CAmber with a small white head. Smells slightly grassy with light sweetness. Taste is similar with hop and malt quite well balanced. A nice general bitter.</p>

<p>Ruddles County Copper coloured bitter, with a quite sweet caramel malt taste. Rounded out with a little hops and some more biscuity malt. Long lasting aftertaste. Drinkable, but seems to be playing it safe.</p>

<p>Tolly English Ale Light copper, with very little head. Smells sweet and malty. Tastes quite tropical with malt undertones. Good flavour, especially given the ABV. A good session beer.</p>

<p>### Grey Trees</p>

<p>Chinookan As the name suggests, a single hop ale. Definite citrus hops in the aroma. Very clean and drinkable. Would make a very good session beer.</p>

<p>### Grolsch Bierbrouwerij</p>

<p>Grolsch Pale golden with large white head. Smells a bit skunky/musty with some grain notes. Taste, what there is, is similar. Slightly better than some typical Eurolagers.</p>

<p>### Grupo Modelo</p>

<p>Negra Modelo Although it‚Äôs Mexican, it was originally brewed by Austrian immigrants, which my explain why it‚Äôs actually pretty authentic. Amber in colour with a caramel maltiness and acme light bitterness. Not a great beer, but much better than I expected.</p>

<p>### Gueuzerie Tilquin</p>

<p>Oude Gueuze Smells very much like a gueuze, with sour and musy notes. Clear golden with very fine bubbles of tight, white head. Very tart with sour fruit notes. Quite an extreme gueuze, but very nice.</p>

<p>### Guinness</p>

<p>Dublin Porter Very, very dark brown with small off-white head. Good mix of sweetness and bitterness. Very smooth and drinkable with roast malt and light coffee notes.</p>

<p>Guinness Draught As you‚Äôd expect from something that‚Äôs mass-marketed, it‚Äôs very smooth and gentle, and, whilst it‚Äôs not a patch on the export bottled versions, it‚Äôs an excellent choice that‚Äôs widely available. Famous black with white head, has roasted malts and a faint hop tang that is all blended together expertly. Not too heavy to drink a `few‚Äô pints in an evening.</p>

<p>Guinness Extra Cold Guinness Draught, but colder. All this achieves is damping down the taste. I don‚Äôt see the point, even in summer, but there‚Äôs really nothing different to the draught version, especially if you put it in the sun in a sunny beer garden for a bit.</p>

<p>Guinness Foreign Extra Pours like oil, with a head that leaves lots of lacing as it quickly disappears. Smells sweeter than the Irish versions. Warming, dark roasted, alcoholic taste - almost like an Imperial stout. Sourer than the other Guinnesses.</p>

<p>Guinness Foreign Extra Very different to the Nigerian brew of the same name. Much less of an aroma, but has the same roasted malt taste. Despite the percentage, tastes somewhere between the Special Export and Original, being somewhat fizzy and more mild in taste than the Special Export.</p>

<p>Guinness Milk Stout Very dark brown with tan head that disappears almost instantly. Aroma has mineral notes and sweetness. Quite fizzy. Taste is quite sweet with a lingering bitterness and an almost acidic finish. A pretty good milk stout.</p>

<p>Guinness Original Looks great, thick, with an off-white head. Malty aroma, and somewhat fizzy on the tongue. Very drinkable, but missing the warmth and kick of the stronger export versions.</p>

<p>Guinness Red Essentially Guinness-light; lighter malt, lighter taste. I‚Äôm not really sure why you‚Äôd drink it. If you want a stout, drink Guinness, if you want a smoothflow bitter, pick another one.</p>

<p>Guinness Special Export Very dark, with an off-white head. Smells of dark, roast malts. Very smooth and incredibly drinkable. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, all the things you want from a stout. Surprisingly bitter hoppiness for such a dark beer.</p>

<p>Rye Pale Ale Orangey-golden with just off-white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Initially clean with some spice and bitterness. Finish is a bit muddled and lingers. OK but nothing special. Not sure that the rye is a good thing.</p>

<p>West Indies Porter Jet black with small tan head. Roast malt with alcohol and hops. Good mix of sweetness, bitterness, malt and a slight tingle. Quite a lot like the special export with roast coffee finish.</p>

<p>### Gulpner</p>

<p>Chateau Neubourg Pilsner Clear golden with small white head. Smells like a pils - some grass and malty. Clean and slightly bitter, with a little bit of grain/grass.</p>

<p>### HaandVryggeriet</p>

<p>Fyr and Flamme Reddish with small bubbles of white head. Some fruit and hops in the nose. Slight citrus (orange?) taste, leading to a bittersweet finish with a hop dryness.</p>

<p>### Hacker-Pschorr Brau</p>

<p>Animator Dark copper with a rapidly-vanishing head. Smells sweet and strong. Taste is surprisingly light on alcohol, with some caramel and malt. Also some warming, spice notes, along with a touch of marzipan? Worryingly drinkable!</p>

<p>Hacker-Pschorr Kellerbier Slightly hazy golden with a large, frothy white head. Slightly sweet and malty. Finish is clean with some spice and bitterness.</p>

<p>Hacker-Pschorr M√ºncher Helles Clear golden with a small white head. Smells grassy with bready malt and some sweetness. Taste is clean and grainy with some hop. Clean and crisp and very drinkable. An excellent summer beer, but doesn‚Äôt try to do too much.</p>

<p>Oktoberfest Clear golden with a small white head which froths well. Really not a lot of aroma, some sweetness and grain. A little fizz in the mouth. Taste again has a bit of grain and sweetness, but there‚Äôs not a huge amount of taste.</p>

<p>### Hadrian Border</p>

<p>Farne Island Amber coloured. Smell has a greenness to it, which is somewhat off-putting. A reasonable blend of malt and hops, but the smell isn‚Äôt great at all and mars the taste.</p>

<p>Secret Kingdom Dark and rich. Smells jammy, with sweetness and blackcurrant notes. Roasted malts dominate and are followed by some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Hambleton</p>

<p>Mindful IPA Golden with a white head. Aroma of light malt and citrus hops. Taste is similar, with a bit of sweetness. It‚Äôs a very decent light beer and hard to tell that is low alcohol.</p>

<p>### Hanlons</p>

<p>Copper Glow Deep copper colour. Quite a lot going on, but dominated by being sweet and sticky. Still a good pint though.</p>

<p>### Hanssens Artisanaal</p>

<p>Oude Gueuze Pop cork bottle. Orangey-yellow with large bubbles of head. Lots of large carbonation, especially on the sides of the glass. Smells sour, with champagne and cider notes. Fizzy and crisp mouthfeel. Very dry and tart, this definitely isn‚Äôt a quaffing beer. Makes you salivate. Apple sourness continues into a dry finish. Would be good with food, it does get a bit sour otherwise.</p>

<p>### Harbour</p>

<p>India Pale Ale Golden with lots of fine streams of carbonation and a large, thought white head. Aroma has hops, mostly flowery. Clean and light with some hop bitterness and fruit, but could do with more. Lightly dry finish.</p>

<p>### Hardknott</p>

<p>Cool Fusion Golden with white head. Smells and tastes of spices. A bit weird but drinkable.</p>

<p>Dark Energy Very dark, with a massive, frothy tan head. Smells rich, dark and fruity with spice notes. Very fizzy. Some bitter-sweet notes and a bit of spice. Very complex, but the fizz is too dominant.</p>

<p>English Experiment Copper with a large white head. Lots of hops in the aroma. Quite a lot of fizz in the mouth. Flavour is a well-rounded mix of hops. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Hardy and Hansons</p>

<p>Rocking Rudolph Dark ruby with a small head. Some hops and spiciness. Some fruit and caramel, although a bit thin. Distinctly average.</p>

<p>### Harvey‚Äôs</p>

<p>Armada Ale Copper with very little head. Very average bitter, but that‚Äôs not always a bad thing; perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>Le Coq Imperial Extra Double Stout A recreation of a 19th Century beer, complete with a cork. Smells of dates/raisins, with the addition of some malt. Very dark, with a warming alcoholic hit. Complex, with dark fruits and a smokey, almost burnt note. Long finish, with more of the same tastes.</p>

<p>### Harvistoun Brewing Company</p>

<p>Bitter and Twisted Very clear and bright with a small white head. Smells quite soapy, with some chemical undertones. Light and crisp, but the soapy smell is somewhat overpowering. A few hops in the finish, but a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>Grizzly Darkish brown with creamy white head. Resinous hops in the nose. Loads of hops, bitter and slightly spicy in the mouth. Very reminiscent of a dark American IPA. Interesting.</p>

<p>Natural Blonde Pale golden with white head. Some light hopping in the aroma. Plenty of hops in the taste with a lovely lingering bitterness. Clean and easy drinking.</p>

<p>Ola Dubh 12 Very dark with small tan head. Smells dark and sweet with hints of treacle and alcohol. Very rich and full bodied with liquorice, bitterness, roasted malt and light alcohol notes. Very complex and rich. Definitely a sipping beer!</p>

<p>Ola Dubh 18 With the name meaning black oil, it‚Äôs unsurprising that this pours a very viscous black. Aroma and taste are both peaty whisky, with an accompanying thick mouthfeel. Tastes very strong (perhaps even stronger than the ABV), but this provides a nice warming accompaniment to the smokey aftertaste.</p>

<p>Old Engine Oil Very dark, essentially black. No head, but some fizz and tan lacing. Smells of chocolate and nuts (nutella?), with some coffee notes. Very chocolatey with a little dark fruit. Lots of dry roasted malt in the finish. Not too heavy. Very full finish to a very nice beer.</p>

<p>Schiehallion Pale golden colour with a small white head. Not a huge amount of carbonation. Smells hoppy and slightly florally. Surprisingly full mouthfeel, hops and bitterness. Like a good German lager.</p>

<p>Shenanigans Black Lager Brewed as Schiehallion, but with the addition of roasted malt and barley. Very dark brown with little head. Smells of roasted malt. Not a huge amount of taste, may benefit from being served a little colder.</p>

<p>Sorachi Pils Pale golden, with tight white head. Quite an astringent bitterness in both the aroma and taste. Perfectly drinkable but nothing exciting.</p>

<p>The Ridge Pale golden with a hoppy aroma. Surprisingly malty at first, leading to bitter and slightly resinous hops. a bit jarring.</p>

<p>Wild Hop IPA Pale golden with patchy, bubbly white head. Clean, bitter, hoppy aroma. Taste is similar, definitely dominated by bitter, drying hops, but very clean with a good, lingering finish.</p>

<p>### Hastings</p>

<p>Handmade 18:Rye A RyePA. Very dark, although that belies the amount of hops in both the aroma and taste. Mostly fruity, with a bitter finish. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Hatherwood</p>

<p>Plunged Orange Amber with a white head. Smell is definitely orange, almost soft-drink-like. Flavour is much better balanced with light orange notes, some bitterness from hops and sweetness. Quite fizzy.</p>

<p>The Green Gecko It‚Äôs a new world IPA. Tropical fruits and zesty hops in the aroma and taste. Spicy, peppery finish. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Hausbraurei Zum Schlussel</p>

<p>Schl√ºssel Alt Dark, completely clear with a dense head. Mild carbonation. Smells malty with some hop bitterness. Taste is slightly sweet with some fruitiness, presumably from the combination of hops and malts. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Hawkshead</p>

<p>Lakeland Gold Copper with a white head which has good lacing. Smells of floral and fruity hops. Taste has good malt with some citrus hop bitterness, which lingers in the finish. A very drinkable beer.</p>

<p>NZPA Very pale with a small, creamy white head. Flowery, fruity and slightly bitter hops in the aroma. Taste isn‚Äôt as complex as the aroma, dominated by malt and grapefruit hops. Good lingering bitterness. Gets mote complex as you drink it; more in line with the aroma.</p>

<p>Windermere Pale Bright golden with patchy white head. Clean, dry hop aroma. Some fizz in thr mouth. More dry hops with some alcohol noted and a long, lingering dry, peppery finish.</p>

<p>### Hay Rake</p>

<p>Dawn Call Thyme Golden coloured. Definite thyme in the aroma; no messing about here. Taste is essentially a very nice, clean, golden ale with thyme. Very interesting and drinkable. More beer should be like this.</p>

<p>### Heavy Seas Beer</p>

<p>Heavy Seas Pale Ale Clear golden. Smells quite florally with some bready malts. Taste is similar, with not much hopping. Quite sweet. Crisp and refreshing with not too much fizz.</p>

<p>Loose Cannon Golden with a finger or so of white head which has good lacing. Smells of hops! Plenty of citrus/grapefruit with some pine resin. Taste is very well balanced between the bitter, citrus and resin flavours. Very easy to drink. Medium body with little carbonation. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Heineken</p>

<p>Birra Moretti Average continental lager, very pale and not too fizzy. Not much aroma or taste, some sweetness. Pretty bland.</p>

<p>Heineken Clear yellow. Smells a bit skunky. Quite sweet. Pretty much your generic continental lager. A bit better than Carlsberg etc, but not much.</p>

<p>### Hepworth</p>

<p>Bangla Pale yellow with lots of fizz and froth but no real lasting head. Very little aroma, some sweetness. Grainy malt with a little sweetness. Much more taste and less fizz in the mouth than your average ‚Äòcurry lager‚Äô.</p>

<p>### Herforder Brauerei</p>

<p>Herforder Pils A very lagery pils. Clear golden. Crisp taste with a little tingle. Dull and uninspiring.</p>

<p>### Herzoglich Bayerisches Brauhaus Tegernsee</p>

<p>Tegernseer Hell Pale golden, smells grassy with some sweetness and very light hopping. Fizzy mouthfeel. Clean tasting with a tang in the finish. Well balanced, clean and simple. Refreshing and a very nice biergarten summer beer.</p>

<p>### High House Farm</p>

<p>Auld Hemp Copper with white head that leaves sticky lacing. A bit nondescript. A good session beer.</p>

<p>### Highland Brewing Company</p>

<p>Light Munro Dark ruby coloured, with dark fruit and chocolate in the aroma. Delicate taste with some sweet chocolate malt and a little hops. Very good session beer.</p>

<p>Orkney Blast Very poor, tasted mostly of alcohol and wood.</p>

<p>Orkney IPA Golden colour with a small white head. Smells, as it should, of hops and citrus. Very clean and refreshing with some malty mouthfeel. A nicely hoppy IPA.</p>

<p>### Hobsons</p>

<p>Old Henry Brown with very tight, creamy white head. Little aroma through the head. Clean and malty. Nothing special but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>Town Crier Very pale with a slightly scummy white head. Smells a bit vegetable. Subtle hops with a bit of dryness. A good, quaffable session beer.</p>

<p>Twisted Spire Pale golden, with a good foamy white head and streams of carbonation, Smells of both citrus and dry hops with a little sweetness. Big, zesty grapefruit hit leads into a lovely dry aftertaste. Very drinkable and refreshing, would be a nice summer session beer.</p>

<p>### Hofbrauhaus Freising</p>

<p>Huberweises Original Golden, hazy, with a couple of fingers of tight white head. Smells yeasty with some clove notes. Light compared to some German weisbiers, with a crisp mouthfeel with clove notes and a slightly sour lemony finish.</p>

<p>### Hofbrauhaus Traunstein Josef Sailer</p>

<p>Oktoberfest Slightly spicier (corriander/funk) than the others. Fine carbonation, but very gassy in the mouth. Very little taste, some sweetness and then a chemically dryness. Maybe a little metallic.</p>

<p>### Hogs Back</p>

<p>A over T Smells seriously strong, with some popcorn notes and a bit of sweetness. Tastes incredibly strong, fairly complex and interesting though.</p>

<p>BSA (Burma Star Ale) Comes with a wine-style cover over the top. Very little aroma. Good carbonation (bottle conditioned) with a slightly hoppy taste. Very clean, but a little bland.</p>

<p>Summer Ale Surprisingly dark for a summer ale. Bubbly, slightly off-white head. Smells of hops. Clean and refreshing with a nice kick of hops.</p>

<p>T.E.A. (Traditional English Ale) Slight apple/fruit flavour, with a surprising amount of hoppy bitterness. Lasting, dry finish. It‚Äôs drinkable, but all a bit standard and safe.</p>

<p>### Holdens</p>

<p>Golden Glow Pale golden, with good carbonation which gives a largish white head on pouring. Some hop in the aroma, and a little sulphur. Crisp hop taste with a good dryness. Tingly, with a slightly citric dryness in the finish. OK, but not overly exciting.</p>

<p>Golden Pale Ale Very little head. Smells of grain. Golden/light amber in colour. Some initial hops, followed by malt and a slightly bitter aftertaste. Good session beer.</p>

<p>Golden Special Bitter Frothy white head. Sweet malt aroma with some bitterness coming through. Tingly mouthfeel, lots of malt with a lingering dry bitterness. A little acidic. Perfectly drinkable, if not very memorable.</p>

<p>Satisfaction Golden with a creamy white head. Plum/apple fruity hop notes in the aroma. Taste is pretty similar with some bitterness. A very drinkable beer.</p>

<p>### Hook Norton</p>

<p>Copper Ale Copper coloured (shock) with a frothy white head. Malty, sweet and flowery aroma. Lots and lots of fizz in the mouth. Good flavour, but nothing that special.</p>

<p>Copper Ale Copper with a small white head. Smells quite fruity. Taste has some spice and bitterness, backed up by some roasted, smokey malt. Nice, lingering dry finish.</p>

<p>Double Stout Very dark, with a frothy dark tan head. Smells slightly sweet, with dark, roasted malts and some dark winter fruit. Maybe a few hints of chocolate. Not too carbonated, and nicely rounded in the mouth. Roasted malt and a dry finish, cut through with a little hop bitterness.</p>

<p>Haymaker Pale copper with a small white head. Good mix of hops and malts in both the aroma and taste. Quite a lot of fizz in the mouth, but it‚Äôs combated by the hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Hooky Dark Very dark, with a roasted malt flavour. Quite mild aroma and taste, although there‚Äôs some hop in there. Incredibly drinkable, but not wonderfully exciting.</p>

<p>Hooky Gold Golden in colour, with a surprising amount of carbonation. Thick white head dissipates after a few minutes. Smells of light malt with some grapefruit notes and hoppiness. Taste is similar; the bitterness is very refreshing. Pretty light, but you could certainly drink a lot of this.</p>

<p>Old Hooky Copper coloured, with a malty, well rounded smell, some caramel and fruitiness. Quite simple, with a little fruit and a slightly dry aftertaste.</p>

<p>Twelve Days Smells slightly sweet, possibly dark fruit. Dark brown. Taste has some spice with a little bitterness. Also nuts, sweetness and malt. Solid, and actually pretty good for a Christmas beer.</p>

<p>### Hop Back</p>

<p>Crop Circle Very clear, light golden. Smells and tastes of grain with a very musty finish. Has some bitterness, but not in a hoppy way. Slightly chemically.</p>

<p>Pickled Santa No thanks. Smells of toilets, tastes vaguely of grapefruit, very thin in the mouth.</p>

<p>Summer Lightning Very pale, with a frothy white head and little aroma, although perhaps a touch of citrus hoppiness. Sharp carbonation, quite refreshing, but a bit bland.</p>

<p>Winter Lightning Quite light in colour with a frothy head. Very malty with some sweetness and a hint of bitterness in the aftertaste. Quite drying with some form of spicing, possibly ginger.</p>

<p>### Hop Daemon</p>

<p>Green Daemon Slightly hazy golden with a tight white head. Smells slightly hoppy. Tastes surprisingly smokey. Not at all what I expected, but pretty good. It‚Äôs really not a helles though.</p>

<p>### Hop Federation</p>

<p>American Brown Ale  Dark copper with bubbly white head. Coffee malt aroma with loads of similar flavour and a good bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Hop Stuff</p>

<p>1888 Golden with tight white head. Grain and spice in the aroma. Very bitter. Perfectly drinkable but nothing exciting.</p>

<p>### Hopfenstark</p>

<p>7 Sisters: Alcyone Jet black, with tan head that leaves good lacing. Bitter aroma, with coffee notes and resin. Taste is dominated by the aftertaste, which is dry and yeasty. A bit odd, but drinkable.</p>

<p>### Hopping Mad</p>

<p>Fruitcase Golden in colour, smells slightly fruity, in a general, rather than specific way. Some hop bitterness in the lingering finish.</p>

<p>### Hopshackle</p>

<p>Hopshackle Imperial Stout ‚Äò09 Pretty much jet black and opaque, with a very small tan head. Smells of raster malt, with maybe some coffee. Surprisingly little alcohol in the nose, but lots of roasted malt, with chocolate and liquorice in both the aroma and taste. Also some boozy dark fruit. Smooth and dry finish, although the body was a little thinner than I was expecting.</p>

<p>### Hopyard</p>

<p>Golden Ale Golden. Tastes like snakebite. Well rounded, smooth, and lightly hopped.</p>

<p>### Horal</p>

<p>Oude Gueuze 2015 Orange golden with frothy white head. Skunky, wild yeast, slightly sour aroma. Quite tingly. Complex with a range of yeast, fruit and sour notes. Very cleverly done.</p>

<p>### Hornbeam</p>

<p>Mary Rose Dark golden with some slight floral bitterness in the smell and taste. Massively unexciting, I could take it or leave it.</p>

<p>### Houston</p>

<p>Auld Cooperheid Copper coloured with a tight, creamy white head. Aroma is malts and hops, taste is similar, dominated by the malts but with a hoppy bitterness in the finish. Probably a good session ale, but a bit too dull as a one-off.</p>

<p>Black and Tan Jet black with creamy white head. Roasted malt and some dark fruit in the aroma. Very smooth and drinkable with a full body and a nice crisp bitterness in the finish. Excellent winter session beer.</p>

<p>Festival Ale Pale golden with very tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Quite a lot of bitter hops. Slightly unbalanced but drinkable.</p>

<p>Slainte Dark golden/copper coloured. Clean, hoppy smell with some malt and fruity hops. Somehow it‚Äôs just a bit generic.</p>

<p>Texas Ruby with some sourness in the aroma. Spicy hops, quite interesting.</p>

<p>Warlock Very dark with off-white head. Smells roasted and full bodied. Dry and roasted with a good bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Howling Hops</p>

<p>Imperial Stout Fighting Ale Opaque black with frothy brown head. Loads of roasted notes in the aroma. Some chocolate, too. Smooth but with a definite alcohol kick. Roasted flavours build, leading to an almost creamy aftertaste and some more alcohol notes. Obviously strong, but it works.</p>

<p>### Huisbrouwerij Boelens</p>

<p>Santa Bee Light brown and hazy with a small white head. Spice and cherry/stone fruits in the aroma. Taste is fruity with alcohol, leading to an astringent finish. Lots of alcohol in the finish as well, along with an odd fruitiness.</p>

<p>Tripel Klok Cloudy golden with it eventually stops frothing like mad, unsurprisingly leading to a large, creamy white head. Smells of citrus and slightly sour/flowery hops. Very tingly in the mouth. Surprisingly light with similar tastes to the aroma. Very drinkable, especially given the ABV.</p>

<p>### Huisbrouwerij Sint Canarus</p>

<p>Sint Canarus Tripel Golden with a large white head. Smells like a triple should. Tastes like it too, with spice and fruit notes with candy sugar. Too watery to be a classic though.</p>

<p>### Hunter‚Äôs</p>

<p>Half Bore Amber coloured. Smells bittersweet. Smooth and sweet, with not a huge amount going on. A clean and pretty standard bitter - probably good with food.</p>

<p>### Idle Valley</p>

<p>Indolent Philosopher Very dark with small tan head. Smells of roasted malt. Very smooth and rich with enough bitterness in the finish to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>### Ilkley</p>

<p>Dinner Ale Very pale golden with rapidly vanishing white head. Light, crisp and dry hop aroma. Loads of flavour with a good initial slightly spicy hop hit followed by a lingering dry hop bitterness. Very nice, especially given the ABV.</p>

<p>Ilkley Black Very dark mild, smells of roasted malts. Very small head. Incredibly drinkable, with a little fizz on the tongue. Much lighter than the colour suggest.</p>

<p>Lotus IPA No head. As expected smells predominantly of hops. Some spicy hops and a little dryness. Nicely drinkable.</p>

<p>Siberia Rhubarb saison. Hazy golden. Smells a bit odd - I get some sweet, BBQ sauce-like notes. Pretty drinkable, some sharpness (from the rhubarb?), spice and vanilla creaminess. Bittersweet finish. OK, but I don‚Äôt really get the rhubarb.</p>

<p>Smoked Witch Copper red with a bubbly white head. Smells a little smokey, but not a huge amount. Also some sweetness and a bit of dried fruit. Taste is mostly smokey with a slight bitterness, which dominates the finish.</p>

<p>Stout Mary Almost black, with a slight tan head. Roasted malt and some smokiness in the aroma. Good, roasted flavour with a few hop notes lending some bitterness. Perhaps a bit too think to be an great stout.</p>

<p>### Innis and Gunn</p>

<p>Barrelmaster‚Äôs Reserve Amber coloured. Lots of sweetness, oak and vanilla in the aroma. Tastewise it‚Äôs a complete mess. Very sweet and sticky with too much alcohol and vanilla. Didn‚Äôt finish!</p>

<p>Blood Red Sky Matured in rum barrels. Definite sweet and alcohol notes. Taste is spicy and sweet. Not really my kind of beer, but does what it says on the label.</p>

<p>Gunnpowder IPA Clear golden with large bubbles and some bubbles of head, too. Lots of citrus (grapefruit) and pine in the aroma. Big hit of hop bitterness followed by some citrus tang and an almost dry-sweet finish. Clean and interesting to drink.</p>

<p>Innis and Gunn Blonde Honey coloured with a small foamy white head. Smells of buttery vanilla and some alcohol. Tastes of vanilla with a little fruit and oaky whisky. Has more of a hoppy finish than the regular one. Nice, but I‚Äôd struggle to drink more than one.</p>

<p>Innis and Gunn Bourbon Smells of vanilla, with a slight coffee sweetness. Light yellow-amber colour with medium carbonation. Quite smooth, with vanilla and sweetness, and some, but not enough, dryness. Tastes pretty much like cream soda.</p>

<p>Innis and Gunn Highland Cask Dark copper with some white head. Not a huge amount of aroma; some whisky notes. Mouthfeel has fizz and a nice warmth from the alcohol. Lots of spicy, whisky notes with some building floweriness. Almost rum-like taste at times. Very nice.</p>

<p>Innis and Gunn Lager Pale golden with bubbly white head and lots of bubbles. Grain aroma. Very tasty for a lager, with a clean finish.</p>

<p>Innis and Gunn Oak Aged Dark amber, vanishing slightly off-white head. Sweet aroma with some toffee and definite oak. Also plenty of vanilla. Taste is similar to the aroma, with very dominant vanilla. Smooth and drinkable for one, although the vanilla could be quickly overpowering.</p>

<p>Innis and Gunn Rum Cask Matured in navy rum barrels. Clear reddish with a small tan head, which vanishes quickly. Aroma is sweet caramel, with some oakiness and definite rum notes. Flavour is woody with rum and a small amount of vanilla. Nice, but perhaps a tad too sweet.</p>

<p>Scotch Whisky Porter Very dark brown with large, frothy tan head and lots of fizz out the bottle. Smells sweet and rich, with pear drop notes. Definite alcohol notes, but not overwhelming. Some dark fruit but no obvious whisky. Full bodied and smooth.</p>

<p>Smokin‚Äô Gunn Reddish brown with no head. Wood smoke aroma along with some sweetness. Quite a lot of fizz. More sweet than smokey, but some smoke in the finish. Quite complex.</p>

<p>Treacle Porter Dark chestnut with bubbles of white head. Smells sweet and spicy. Actually quite thin mouthfeel; was expecting more richness. Actually dominated by oak like normal I&amp;G.</p>

<p>### Inveralmond</p>

<p>Fionnar Coffee stout. As you‚Äôd expect, it‚Äôs dark with a brown head. Aroma and taste of coffee and roast malts, with some bitterness. Quite thin, otherwise very nice.</p>

<p>Homecoming Scotland Dark golden with creamy white head. Sweet aroma. Quite bland, with a malt dominated finish. OK.</p>

<p>Independence Bright golden with tight white head. Smells and tastes slightly bitter with a little sourness in the finish. Odd.</p>

<p>Inkie Pinkie Clear golden. Smells Christmassy. Tastes a bit dirty. Some spices AFC sourness. Weird.</p>

<p>Lia Fail Bronze with a thick, creamy off-white head leaving good lacing. Aroma is malty with light roast and sweet notes. Full and rich in the mouth with not a huge amount up front but a pleasing mix of bitterness and chocoalte roasted malt in the finish.</p>

<p>Ossian Pale golden with large, bubbly white head. Zesty hop aroma, with orange notes. Clean and drinkable with sweetish malt followed up by slightly bitter and citrus hops. Nice but nothing special; good session beer.</p>

<p>Rascal Black with cream head. Quite smooth with a nice bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Sunburst Pale golden with quickly vanishing white head. Smells like a pils with ozone and elderflower. Some malt with biscuit in the finish. Lightly hopped. A bit dull, but it‚Äôs a pils.</p>

<p>### Ironbridge</p>

<p>Foundry Gold Gold with a white head. Smells of hops, and a little grass. Very clean, crisp and dry. Incredibly drinkable, especially on a nice summer afternoon.</p>

<p>Foundry Gold Clear golden with a light foam of white head. Smells of light malt and citrus hops. Clean tasting with some hop bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable, I could definitely session this.</p>

<p>### Isca Ales</p>

<p>Devon Pale Golden, with hints of hop and alcohol. Doesn‚Äôt do enough to justify the ABV, although it‚Äôs perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>Porter Dark with a little tan head. Coffee in the aroma, and also in the taste with an accompanying dryness. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Isle of Avalon</p>

<p>Jasmine‚Äôs Chocolate Orange Dark in colour. Huge bitter orange aroma. Tastes almost exactly like a well-known orange chocolate. A bit sweet, but otherwise very interesting.</p>

<p>### Isle of Mull</p>

<p>Terror of Tobermory Dark copper with a washing-up liquid head. Smells of grain and herby/spicy notes. Quite fizzy. Spicy bitterness with light smokey notes and a slightly bitter finish. Quite interesting, but also a bit odd.</p>

<p>### Isle of Skye</p>

<p>Black Cuillin Dark brown with bubbly off-white head. Smells of roasted malt with some honey sweetness. Full and rich mouthfeel, almost like a creamy stout. Nice dryness in the finish with warming spices.</p>

<p>Blaven Deep golden. Smells malty with light hops. Taste is similar. Surprisingly malty with some hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Cuillin Beast Dark copper with a patchy white head. Smells burnt and jammy. Taste is a bit weird with some caramel and fruit. Not well balanced at all. Definite homebrew notes.</p>

<p>Gold Made with porridge oats. Dark golden. Light bitterness in the aroma as well as some sweet fruit notes. Clean, creamy with a little bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Hebridean Gold Gold with a small head. Smells slightly sweet. Tingle in the mouth. Very clean and drinkable, with a slightly bitter finish. Nothing special, but a good sessio beer.</p>

<p>Skye Red Quite deep golden. Smells bitter, sweet and nutty. Taste is similar. OK.</p>

<p>Tarasgeir Clear golden with a patchy white head and no carbonation. Smells peaty. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy. Tastes like an islay malt with ice and water. Some sour gueuze-like notes in the finish, and perhaps a touch of ginger. The smokiness comes to dominate as it warms up. Weird, but not in a bad way, although I suspect this is a love-it-or-hate-it beer.</p>

<p>### Itchen Valley</p>

<p>Calypso Pale golden with a slightly frothy white head. Slight hop aroma. Dry-hopped taste with some grassy notes. Finish is quite dry.</p>

<p>Treacle Stout Slightly off-black with a ruby hint. Strong aroma of caramel and malts. Tastes of roasted malt, with treacle/toffee overtones. Quite smooth, it‚Äôs rich rather than sweet.</p>

<p>### J Boag and son</p>

<p>James Boag‚Äôs Tasmanian lager. Golden with frothy white head. Smells sweet and malty. Not too fizzy. Some sweetness and malt. Nothing special, but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>### J. W. Lees</p>

<p>Brewer‚Äôs Dark Looks like coke, with no head and large bubbles of carbonation. Smells slightly sweet with roasted malt. Quite thin in the mouth (which is probably to be expected from the ABV) but some sweet and coffee notes. Has a fizzy, tingly finish.</p>

<p>Harvest Ale 10 Golden with fine streams of carbonation. No real head, but a small amount of bubbly lacing. Smells very well-rounded with lots of sweet malt. Oddly for the ABV, there‚Äôs no real alcohol notes. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is very complex with some sweet molasses malts and a lingering finish of spice and dark sugar. Also some smokey notes. No alcohol burn. Very nice.</p>

<p>Manchester Star Ale Smells dark and alcoholic with roasted malt and sweetness. Rich and smooth with roasted flavours and since sweetness. Definite sipping beer.</p>

<p>The Governor Created by Marco Pierre White. Golden with a few bubbles of small, white head. Smells malty and bitter. Tastes similar. Overall, quite bitter and not very good.</p>

<p>### JBJ</p>

<p>JBJ VI Wheat Very slightly hazy golden with no head and no carbonation. Smells slightly floral with yeast notes. A bit thin. Light sourness and some alcohol dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Jaw Brew</p>

<p>7 Bells Jet black with creamy head. Alcohol and roasted notes, but pretty well balanced aroma. There‚Äôs definitely alcohol notes, but also some creaminess and roasted malts, with a bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Drop Gold with a tight head. Floral and citrus aroma. Described as a session IPA and rather lacking in punch, but definitely drinkable.</p>

<p>Reef Zesty hop aroma with light malt. Clean and crisp with a little bitterness in the finish. Nothing particularly special but nothing wrong with it either.</p>

<p>Surf Golden with very tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. However, loads of exotic fruity hops in the taste. This could easily be a very fancy Belgian beer. This is a seriously good beer.</p>

<p>Wave Hazy dark golden with tight white head. Smells slightly spicy with a bit of banana. Typical weissbier flavours. Probably shouldn‚Äôt be served at real ale temperature.</p>

<p>### Jennings</p>

<p>Cocker Hoop Dark gold, quite fizzy with a white head. Smells quite biscuity with a touch of lemon citrus. Tastes similar with some grain and balanced hops.</p>

<p>Cumberland Ale Golden orange with a good head that leaves lots of lacing. Not a huge amount of aroma, perhaps some malt. Mainly malt in the taste, with some dry hops in the aftertaste. Good session beer.</p>

<p>Sheep Thrills Clear golden with very tight white head. Slight flowery hop aroma. Very crisp taste with a floral finish.</p>

<p>Snecklifter Dark burgundy colour, with a creamy head. Smells of dark fruit, with perhaps some coffee. Incredibly drinkable, although very complex, with bitter hops, malts and fruit. Lovely smooth mouthfeel, like a good stout. Long, pleasant aftertaste, far too drinkable for its strength.</p>

<p>Westmorland Ale Light golden with a tight white head. Smells of light malt with a bit of hopping. Very clean in the mouth with a light hop taste. Nice session beer, but a bit unexciting.</p>

<p>### Jeremiah Weed</p>

<p>Sour Mash Brew Brewed with bourbon and fruit alcohol, whatever that is. Initial aroma is very odd, somewhat like a shandy, although the taste isn‚Äôt so bad. Quite sweet and sticky with cola notes. Too sweet.</p>

<p>### Jever</p>

<p>Jever Pils Disappointing, very bitter, but not in a good way. Smells grassy, tastes slightly sweet, almost like it‚Äôs not fully matured, but then has a shockingly bitter aftertaste.</p>

<p>### John Martin‚Äôs</p>

<p>Gordon Finest Gold Golden with a vanishing white head. No obvious carbonation. Smells slightly sweet and alcoholic. Tastes similar. Dull with a strange vegetablyness.</p>

<p>John Martin‚Äôs IPA Hazy golden with frothy white head. Smells a bit lagery with floral hops. A bit metallic with some herbiness and a little sweetness, with a dry finish. Quite a lot of tingle in the mouth. Some hints of a generic lager.</p>

<p>John Martin‚Äôs Pale Ale Copper with small white, bubbly head. Large bubbles of carbonation but not that fizzy in the mouth. Smells of malt with caramel. Taste is biscuity with caramel and a little hop in the aftertaste. Bitter and sweet but a bit confused and not very crisp or clean; a bit unbalanced.</p>

<p>### John Smiths</p>

<p>Newcastle Brown Ale Dark copper, very clear with almost no head. Smells sweet with some light wood notes. Sweet and malty taste. Medium body with a good amount of carbonation. A very solid beer.</p>

<p>Newcastle Summer Ale Golden in colour. Smells very grainy, with some sweetness and fruit notes. Quite fizzy. Grain, light malt and some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Jopen</p>

<p>Extra Stout Very dark with large, creamy tan head. Smooth and creamy mouthful. Quite light for a stout. Some sweetness; a bit like a milk stout.</p>

<p>Gerstebier Surprisingly cloudy golden with white head. Smells and tastes soapy. Also some citrus and spice.</p>

<p>Jopen Hoppenbier Slightly cloudy golden, with white head. Smells like a Belgian pale ale with a bit of candy sugar and some dry hops, No obvious fizz, however, very fizzy on the tongue. Plenty of dryness in the aftertaste, but the fizz masks any actual taste.</p>

<p>Tempelbier Pale golden, white lacy head. Smells quite sweet. Doesn‚Äôt taste of a lot. Distinctly average but drinkable. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Joseph Holt</p>

<p>Maplemoon Copper coloured with some fizz. Very little head. Aroma is slightly sweet. Mouthfeel has a nice tingle. Taste is slightly sweet, but manages to be quite refreshing.</p>

<p>Two Hoots Golden with a food white head. Smells of light malt and vaguely fruity hops. Good hop bitterness backed up by grassy malts. Unspectacular but drinkable.</p>

<p>### Kaltenberg</p>

<p>Kaltenberg Hell Golden, with quite a lot of fizz. Small white head. Smells of caramel malt. Smooth, surprisingly full mouthfeel. Not a huge amount of hops, and only a little dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Kelburn Brewing Company</p>

<p>Cart Blanche Pale golden with frothy white head. Lots of fresh, citrus hops in the noise. Clean tasting with some fizz in the mouth. Some light sweetness and hop bitterness that builds in a lingering finish.</p>

<p>Dark Moor Dark mahogany with an off-white head. Smells slightly of caramel. Complex balance of dark fruits and hops. Interesting but for some reason I wasn‚Äôt excited by it.</p>

<p>Jaguar Clear golden with a small white head. Lots of hop aroma with soft fruits and also some grassy notes. Taste is clean with citrus bitterness. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Misty Law Blonde-golden in colour, with a frothy white head. Somewhat bland, although it does have some hoppy bitterness. It could do with a bit more then it would probably be a nice session beer.</p>

<p>Pivo Estivo Pale golden with tight white head. Drinkable but dull.</p>

<p>### Kelham Island</p>

<p>Best Bitter Pale golden. Crisp and bitter with some sweetness afterwards. Some subtle hop notes. It‚Äôs not overly interesting, but it is very drinkable.</p>

<p>Easy Rider Very pale, clear golden colour with a small head. A little fizz, light taste with some hop bitterness. A very good session beer - another please!</p>

<p>It‚Äôs Not Dark Yet But It‚Äôs Getting There Dark brown with a small white head. Toasted malts and some smoke in the aroma. Quite well balanced with malts and hops.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas Baby Golden with a white head. Smells very clean. Light bodied, but slightly astringent. Is nicely rounded with plenty of bitterness.</p>

<p>Pale Rider Very pale. Floral and citrus hops dominate the aroma. Taste is well balanced, with good bitterness and a light finish. Drinkable.</p>

<p>### Keltek</p>

<p>4k Mild Dark chestnut with a very musty aroma. Quite watery with some malt. Disappointing.</p>

<p>Beheaded Reddish brown with small just off-white head. Smells of dark fruit with some sweetness. Very sweet with a bitterness in the finish. Definitely tastes like the ABV. Really not that good at all.</p>

<p>Even Keel Amber colour. Smells quite sweet. Taste is dominated by malts. Just not very nice.</p>

<p>King Copper with tight white head. Flowery hop aroma. Very clean with fruity notes and a slightly bitter finish. Also some building sweetness and spice.</p>

<p>Magik Orangey copper with a white head. Smells quite hoppy with citrus notes and a little sweetness. Hit of bitterness in the initial taste, but well-rounded. Very drinkable and the hops keep it interesting.</p>

<p>### Kent</p>

<p>Kent Pale Pale gold. Smells of lemon and grassy hops. Taste is similar, but with some weird, dirty notes.</p>

<p>### Kenya Breweries</p>

<p>Tusker Premium Lager Smells of lager. Light, golden in colour with good carbonation. No head. Fizzy mouthfeel. Light and clean taste. Not a bad pale lager.</p>

<p>### Keystone</p>

<p>Born to be Mild Smells slightly sweet. Tastes like it should be poured straight down the drain.</p>

<p>VPA Light golden with hops in the aroma. Taste has crisp hops with a good balance. Light and very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Kingstone</p>

<p>Humpty‚Äôs Fuggle Dark copper, with a frothy head. Some hoppiness and smole in the smell. Slightly sweet with a warming roundness. Not what you‚Äôd expect from a standard IPA.</p>

<p>### Kinver Brewery</p>

<p>Life Begins Brewed to celebrate Camra‚Äôs 40th birthday. Very pale in colour, aroma is quite bitter. Dry with a bitter aftertaste. Drinkable, but nothing special.</p>

<p>### Kite</p>

<p>Bluestone Bitter Dark copper with no head. Smells slightly bittersweet and the taste is similar. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Kiuchi Brewery</p>

<p>Hitachino Nest White Beer Hazy golden with a thin film of head. Smells of bread and orange, with some spice (coriander) notes. Flavour is much the same, with a bit of tangy orange, hops and spices. Quite sharp, but not too much so. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Kleinbrouwerij De Glazen Toren</p>

<p>Canaster Winterscotch Ale Hazy brown with a fine, tan head. Alcohol and dark fruit in the nose, along with light apple notes. Quite smooth, but at the same time it has a quite astringent, citrus finish. Quickly gets very sticky. Reminiscent of fruit sweets.</p>

<p>Saison D‚ÄôErpe-Mere Hazy blond with a bubbly, white head. Smells of citrus and yeast, with some hopping. Bitter hops and a nice tartness dominate the taste, but it remains well-balanced. Reminiscent of a gueuze mixed with a wittier.</p>

<p>### Klosterbrauerei Andechs</p>

<p>Andechser Bergbock Hell Pale golden with a small, patchy white head. Slightly grainy taste with a little sweetness. Pretty well-rounded, but perhaps a little too sweet. However, there‚Äôs a bit of dryness in the finish. Obviously quite strong and not a quaffing beer.</p>

<p>Andechser Doppelbock Dunkel Rich brownish red colour with a small off-white head. Smells sweet, with caramel malt and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the smell, with some alcohol notes and good body from the malt. Very good example of what a Bock can be, tasty and not overpowered by the alcohol.</p>

<p>Andechser Dunkel Dark copper, with a big head. Smells malty, and the taste is similar, with some sweetness. In fact, a little too sweet, but still a pretty good dunkel.</p>

<p>Andechser Dunkles Weissbier Hazy amber with a huge tan head that disappears after a time. Smells of banana, yeast and a caramel sweetness. Tastes of banana and clove-like spices with some doughy/bready yeast. Medium amount of carbonation and a good mouthfeel.</p>

<p>Andechser Hell Light golden with a thick white head which leaves good lacing. Aroma is mostly malt with some floral notes. Taste is dominated by grain with a light, citrus hop finish. Pretty lightly carbonated.</p>

<p>Andechser Weissbier Hell Bright orange-golden with the sort of haze you‚Äôd expect. White, frothy, thick head. Spice and yeast in the aroma. Loads of good Weissbier flavours with yeast, spice and a bit of citrus. Very clean and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Knops</p>

<p>Revolver Copper with tight, creamy white head. Slightly fruity and malty aroma. Very clean and drinkable with light carbonation, some fruit sweetness and a mild bitterness in the finish. Definitely a session beer.</p>

<p>### Konig Ludwig</p>

<p>K√∂nig Ludwig Dunkel Very dark brown with a small, slightly off-white head. Smells a little burnt with yeast, almost marmite notes. Taste is a mix of very roasted malt and a lot of burnt spice. A little thin, but finished with a good, lingering roasted aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Koskipanimo</p>

<p>Plevnan M√∂rk√∂ Very dark with quite a frothy head. Aroma is a mix of roasted malt, hops and some fruit. Reasonably bitter with some hops. Drinkable.</p>

<p>### Kostritzer Schwarzbierbrauerei</p>

<p>K√∂stritzer Schwarzbier Quite a typical schwarzbier. Essentially a dark pilsner, which is quite gassy. Some fruit on the nose but the taste is mostly malt. Drinkable but a bit bland.</p>

<p>### Kr√°lovsk√Ω Pivovar Kru≈°ovice</p>

<p>Kru≈°ovice Imperial Pale golden. Smells and tastes grainy, with a stronger flavour than I expected from the smell. Some hoppiness, especially in the finish.</p>

<p>### Krenkerup Bryggeri</p>

<p>Krenkerup Rauch Bier Hazy amber with white head. Aroma has plenty of smoke, but it‚Äôs not overpowering like some rauchbiers. Taste is well-balanced. There‚Äôs definitely smoke, but also some sweetness and malt, with earthy notes. A nice smoked beer.</p>

<p>### Krombacher Brauerei</p>

<p>Krombacher Weizen Cloudy and dark gold in colour, with a tight bubbly head. Some citrus and malt, with a little balancing sweetness. Quite fizzy mouthfeel but nicely rounded. Some roasted, almost smokey notes, with a nuttiness. Followed by a slight bitterness in the aftertaste. Quite dry.</p>

<p>### Kubla</p>

<p>Saison Aroma is dominated by chamomile tea, along with other herb notes. Some malt and hops, but definite chamomile, leading to a dry finish with floral notes.</p>

<p>### Kuppers Brauerei</p>

<p>K√ºppers K√∂lsch Straw blonde colour with a decent head. Smells a little of grass. Pretty clean tasting, some hops but not too bitter. Refreshing and very drinkable, but a little on the dull side.</p>

<p>### L‚ÄôAgrivoise</p>

<p>Vue sur l‚ÄôAmer Reddy-copper colour with plenty of tight cream head. Huge hit of American style hops in the aroma; lots of resin notes. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Lots going on, although it‚Äôs dominated by a drying astringency with alcohol notes. Plenty of fruitier hops in the finish keep it quite balanced.</p>

<p>### La Geante</p>

<p>Desruelle Theetten Clear golden with rapidly-vanishing white head. Smells slightly sweet and aloholic. A little fizz in the mouth. Spicy dryness with alcohol.  A bit generic.</p>

<p>### Lancaster Brewery</p>

<p>Lancaster Red Reddish brown. Smells slightly sweet and bitter with hop notes. Roasted malt with some spicy hops that build in the finish.</p>

<p>### Langton</p>

<p>Welland Poacher Copper/bronze in colour with no head at all. Smells slightly weird. Some alcohol notes. Initially quite thin but then very strong tasting with some smoke and spice along with sugary sweetness. Has a warming, bitter-sweet finish.</p>

<p>### Le-Brewery</p>

<p>Harold‚Äôs Revenge Very dark with ruby hues. Tight, very slightly off-white head. Unusual aroma, some sweetness and a few unidentifiable elements. Some sweetness. Complex taste with malt, dark fruit, spice and some sweetness. Clean, hoppy bitterness in the finish. Very complex and very good.</p>

<p>Norman Gold Dark golden with a tight, white head. Flowery, fruity hops in the nose. Clean with a good hit of hops. Some sweet, light malt notes with a hopping that‚Äôs reminiscent of a British IPA. Not surprising given that the brewery is British.</p>

<p>Odo Milk Stout Pitch black with a large, frothy tan head that leaves a lot of lacing. Smells rich and roasted with coffee and a slight sweetness. Very smooth and full, with a slight mouth tingle in the finish. Taste is roasted with dark fruit notes and a slight bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Lech Browary Wielkopolski</p>

<p>Lech Premium Pale straw with white head. Smells of not a lot. Taste is clean, but mostly because there‚Äôs virtually nothing there. Slightly astringent. Reinforces my belief that if a beer claims to be `Premium‚Äô it should be regarded with some suspicion.</p>

<p>### Leeds</p>

<p>Leeds Best Deep amber with creamy head. Smells quite sweet with a little hop dryness. Taste is smooth, with a bitter finish. A bit bland, but a nice session beer.</p>

<p>New Moon Ruby brown with a tan head. Aroma is dark fruit. Slightly sweet on the palate and full of flavour. Toasted notes, with some chocolate and then bitter orange in the finish. Quite like a porter.</p>

<p>### Leek Brewing Company</p>

<p>Black Grouse Stout Very dark and very frothy, presumably due to it being bottled conditioned. Smells slightly sour/burnt with some malty biscuitness. Surprisingly little taste, but does have a dry aftertaste with some hop bitterness.</p>

<p>Double Sunset Golden ale, very small head and not overly fizzy. Smells of fruit and hops. Quite sweet tasting with some hint of peaches.</p>

<p>Rudyard Ruby Dark ruby, with a small tan head. Some malts and a little sweetness in the aroma. Some hops but a strange sourness, although still drinkable. A bit thin.</p>

<p>Staffordshire Gold Very fizzy, clearly bottle conditioned. Bright golden yellow with a frothy head. Floral aroma, some citrus. A nice initial sourness which lasts through to the aftertaste. Very hoppy and dry.</p>

<p>### Lees</p>

<p>Moonraker Reddish-brown with strong malt aroma. Taste is sweet. Definitely too sweet and too alcoholic.</p>

<p>### Left Hand Brewing Company</p>

<p>400 Pound Monkey Light amber, with a thin white head. Aroma is dry hops, some alcohol and citrus, so what you‚Äôd expect from an IPA. Quite a floral taste with some dryness and a contrasting, rounded malt. Some alcohol dryness in the finish, along with some tea-like notes. A little astringent in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>Black Jack Porter Pours black with no head. Strong alcohol notes in the aroma and lots of dark fruit in the taste. Other than that it‚Äôs very flat and dull.</p>

<p>Milk Stout No actual milk in this - it contains lactose. Very dark brown with a finger of tan head, which doesn‚Äôt last all that long. Smells like you‚Äôd expect from a stout with, with roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Initial taste is sweet roasted malts and some slight coffee bitterness coming through. Mouthfeel is very creamy, but there‚Äôs enough carbonation to stop it being cloying.</p>

<p>### Lervig/Hoppin‚Äô Frog</p>

<p>Sippin‚Äô Into Darkness Ok, let‚Äôs get this in early, it‚Äôs amazing. Described as chocolate Martini Imperial stout, and that‚Äôs pretty accurate. Loads of chocolate and some alcohol in the aroma. Clearly high ABV, but it‚Äôs worth it. So much going on and a lingering dry and chocolaty finish with some bitterness.</p>

<p>### Lerwick</p>

<p>Azure Described as a light, hoppy ale. It‚Äôs exactly that with quite a lot of fizz.</p>

<p>Blindside Yep, it‚Äôs black with a foamy white head. Interesting aroma (I have a cold) - pretty complex mix of hops. Plenty of bitterness, with lots of different hop notes. Lingering dry bitterness in the finish. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Liberation</p>

<p>Liberation IPA Golden copper with a white, creamy head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Slightly weird mix of bitterness and dry hops, but finishes quite clean. Lingering, interesting but not quite placable aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Liberty Brewing</p>

<p>Citra Jr Golden with tight bubbles of white head. Passion fruit and tropical fruit in the aroma. Also in the taste. Very, very nice with loads of new world hops.</p>

<p>### Lighthouse</p>

<p>Shipwreck IPA Dark golden with creamy white head. Some slight bitterness in the aroma. Definitely bitter and you can taste the alcohol. Not great, but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>### Lion</p>

<p>Lion Red Golden with big bubbles of carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma - some sweet malt. Taste is clean and refreshing and very uncomplicated.</p>

<p>Waikato Draught Dark golden with small white head. Little aroma. Clean and drinkable with a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Little Creatures Brewing Company</p>

<p>Little Creatures Pale Ale Slightly cloudy amber (unfiltered, which is nice), with a white head that leaves sticky lacing. Smells slightly appley with some malt and almost metallic notes. Crisp taste with some sweetness and citrus hops contrasting nicely with the light malt. Refreshing and very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Little Earth Project</p>

<p>South Island Sour Hazy golden. Definite sour and funky yeast notes in the nose. Actually pretty well balanced. Some sour notes (obviously) but also some dry hops and nothing too harsh. Interesting and very drinkable for the style.</p>

<p>### Little Valley</p>

<p>Python IPA Light brown. Lacking the usual hoppyness, in fact, tastes quite green and underdone.</p>

<p>### Loch Leven</p>

<p>Warrior Queen Clear, dark golden with very fine white head. Sweet and floral aroma that continues into the taste, with a hint of bitterness. Very generic.</p>

<p>### Loch Lomond</p>

<p>Bonnie n Blonde Clear golden with frothy white head. Light citrus aroma. Very clean with a light bitterness and not a lot else going on.</p>

<p>Silkie Stout Very dark with thin lacy head. Rich, malty aroma. Quite understated but smooth (as expected from the name) and enough interesting chocolate sweetness to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>### Loch Ness</p>

<p>Mildness Very dark with small tan head. Aroma of dark fruit. Well round with malt, fruity sweetness and a tingling bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Lodden</p>

<p>Ferryman‚Äôs Gold Pale golden with a frothy white head. Smells slightly citrusy (probably lime). Smooth tasting with a hint of lime. No real aftertaste.</p>

<p>Gorgeous George Red-gold with a small head. Yeasty aroma. Very weird taste, maybe hops with some toffee. Too astringent.</p>

<p>### Long Itch</p>

<p>Fiesta Blonde Golden/blonde colour. Smells of tropical fruit. Light taste with some more tropical fruit in the finish. Apparently hopped four times with American hops. Very drinkable, but maybe it should do a bit more with the hops.</p>

<p>### Longden</p>

<p>Sawn Off Copper coloured. Smells and tastes generic and under done. Possibly at its best at the beer festival.</p>

<p>### Longman</p>

<p>Long Blonde Light golden with a very hoppy aroma. Taste has some hop bitterness but it strays into vinegar sourness, which isn‚Äôt great. However, it‚Äôs still very drinkable, with a slight gueuze edge, which is fine by me. Not sure it‚Äôs deliberate though.</p>

<p>### Lowenbrau</p>

<p>Oktoberfest Clear, very pale gold colour. Unsurprisingly smells of lager. Very little head (beer tasting). Some sweetness with a little fizz on the tongue.</p>

<p>Triumphator Dark copper. Smells sweet and strong with caramel and roasted notes that continue into the taste. Also some spicy bitterness in the finish. Surprisingly clean and the alcohol isn‚Äôt overpowering.</p>

<p>### Luckie Ales</p>

<p>Locura Pale Ale Golden orange with frothy white head. Smells of fruity hops. Resinous, bitter hops, with earthy malt. Good session beer, although watch out for the ABV!</p>

<p>### Lymestone</p>

<p>Ein Stein Golden with a small white head. Aroma is biscuit and citrus hops. Taste is nicely hoppy and the finish is reasonably bitter.</p>

<p>Foundation Stone A golden beer with a light foamy head. Some citrus smell. Very clean and drinkable with a nice hoppy bitterness. Nothing overly exciting though.</p>

<p>Stone The Crows Red with a small, white head. Smells of soft brown sugar and port. Quite thin tasting with coffee in the finish. Some sweet fruit and a little hops.</p>

<p>### Mac‚Äôs</p>

<p>Black Indeed, it is black, with a dark tab head with good lacing. Smells rich and roasted. Taste is similar with roasted malt and chocolate dominating. Some hops in the finish.</p>

<p>Green Beret Copper with very small white head. Fresh, clean, slightly hoppy aroma. Big hit of resin hops leading to a lingering bitterness.</p>

<p>Hop Rocker Clear golden with white head leaving some lacing. Light grain aroma. Crisp and clean, with a grainy finish. Quite fizzy.</p>

<p>Mid Vicious Golden with very little head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Very clean and drinkable, but nothing exciting going on.</p>

<p>Sassy Red Reddish copper with just off white head. Sweetness and malt in the aroma. Clean with some dark fruit sweetness and a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>Smoke House Reddish amber with small white head. Wood fire smoke in the aroma. Taste is similar, with quite a biting smokiness. Interesting, but definitely not for everyone.</p>

<p>Three Wolves Dark golden with small white head. Smells of peppery hops. Taste has similar with some resin notes which linger. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel.</p>

<p>### Mad Hatter</p>

<p>Fat Stout Very dark with creamy tan head. Smells bittersweet with some roasted notes. Lightly carbonated with quite a smooth mouthfeel. Light bitterness and quite creamy. Pretty nice.</p>

<p>### Magic Hat</p>

<p>Number 9 Very clear golden with a very fine, white head and streams of carbonation. Smells very malty with toffee overtones, pineapple and popcorn notes. Tastes like it should be in one of those fancy green squash bottles. Definite lack of beeriness.</p>

<p>### Magic Rock Brewery</p>

<p>Common Grounds Triple coffee porter. No real surprises. It‚Äôs very dark with a brown head. Smell and taste both dominated by coffee. Not too much fizz. Pretty smooth. Does exactly what it says on the can.</p>

<p>Dairyfreak Very black. No head. Lots of dark and roasted aromas. Quite fizzy and sweet. Some bitterness keeps it relatively rounded. Okay.</p>

<p>Fantasma Orange golden with bubbly white head. Large fruity and resinous aroma. Bittersweet taste doesn‚Äôt quite deliver the hops suggested by the aroma. Dry finish. Would definitely not know it‚Äôs gluten free!</p>

<p>High Wire Grapefruit Definitely smells of grapefruit. Also tastes of it. Very clean and drinkable and has grapefruit flavour without being too bitter or overpowering. Nice!</p>

<p>Magic 8 Ball A black IPA. Pitch black with a frothy, tan head, spotted with bubbles of carbonation. Smells strongly of American-style hops. Odd mix of hops and roasted malt, with a chemically finish.</p>

<p>Rapture Deep brown/red with a small slick of head. Smells of pine and grapefruit hops. Very drying/resin hop test with a bit of fizz. Lots of earthiness with bitter orange in the finish. Complex, but very drinkable and different.</p>

<p>Surreal Stout Dark with roasted aromas. Smooth and drinkable. It‚Äôs your basic stout, pretty well done.</p>

<p>Un-human Cannonball Hazy golden orange with a rapildy-diminishing white head. Skunky nose with some burnt orange. Plenty of hops in the mouth with fruit first, leading to a very bitter, drying finish. Doesn‚Äôt taste anything like the ABV. Very drinkable and dangerous. Also suitably complex - you get something different with every sip.</p>

<p>### Magpie</p>

<p>Raven Stout Smells bitter and alcoholic. Tastes burnt and astringent. Punchy stout, but let down by a weird flavour that none of us could pin down.</p>

<p>### Mallinsons</p>

<p>Brewer‚Äôs Gold Golden with a thin foam of white head. Smells of clean, fruity hops. Not too much fizz in the mouth. Bitter, citrus hops lead to a lean, lingering bitterness. Very sessionable</p>

<p>Citra Noir Black with small tan head. Lots of dark fruit in the aroma. Slightly oddly blackcurrant and bitter. Definite cough medicine notes.</p>

<p>Daniella Slightly hazy yellow-golden with small white head. Smells of soft fruits. Quite thin with some bitterness and soft fruit notes. Weird chemical notes. Average.</p>

<p>Huddersfield Pale Ale Orangey-golden. Smells very strongly of hops, both fruity and bitter. Also lots of hops in the mouth, with soft fruit and a good, lingering hop bitterness.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Alias (With Stella/Ella hops.) Slightly hazy golden (b/c) with creamy, tight white head that reduces quickly. Loads of floral/fruit (passionfruit/grapefruit?) in the nose, perhaps a touch of spice as well. Crisp taste with more spice in the mouth leading to a drying bitterness that lingers. Quite and unusual and powerful hop but nice and also something a bit different.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Amarillo Clear golden with fine streams of carbonation and a large, bubbly white head. Floral, orange bitter aroma with plenty of hops. Quite tingly in the mouth with plenty of bitter orange hops. Very nice and exceptionally drinkable.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Bramling Cross Clear golden with fine streams of carbonation and a very small white head. Nose is fruity and bitter. Some tingle in the mouth with a good dry bitterness throughout, especially in the finish. Some light fruity notes.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Chinook Orangey-golden with a small foam of white head. Smells of citrus hops. Taste is similar, with a slowly-building bitterness. Quite crisp, with a good tang in the finish.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Citra Pale golden with a white frothy head. Smells of mango and grapefruit hops. Quite fizzy mouthfeel with a hit of bitter hops, which is long-lasting. Grapefruit tartness and some more rounded fruit flavours. Develops a passion fruit finish.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Columbus Clear golden with a tight white head. Slightly bitter hop aroma. Taste has lots of hot bitterness. Quite bland for a single hop. Very drinkable though.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Galaxy Pale golden with small white head. Lots of light citrus hops in the aroma with some floweriness. Tart and drying with a fruity finish. Very nice.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Hopped Orangey-golden with a frothy white head with good lacing. Smells of light, lemony hops. Dry, citrus hops in the mouth with a nice tingle and a very pleasant dry finish.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Indulgence Brewed using four ‚ÄòC‚Äô hops. Very pale with a bubbly white head. Strong grapefruit aroma from the hops. Also some tropical fruit notes. A complex, yet well-balanced mix of hops, with fruit and spice with a little smoke leading to a lingering dryness and bitter citrus notes. Very nice beer.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Lockwood Golden with a small, just-off-white head. Smells of orange/lemon citrus hops. Nice bitter taste with orange notes and a lingering dryness. Very nice, if not overly complex.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Motueka Light golden. Smells and tastes of fruity hops, with a good bitterness that lingers in the finish. Another very nice beer from Mallinsons.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Nelson Sauvin Clear golden with a white frothy head. Light citrus, grapefruit notes in the aroma. Very nice amount of clean hopping with some spice, especially in the finish.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Oatmeal Stout Jet black with a good froth of light tan head. Lots of roast coffee malt. Full mouthfeel with roast malt and medium bitterness. Slightly drying finish. Overall very nice.</p>

<p>Mallinsons Stadium Pale golden with a frothy white head. Plenty of hop aroma with bitterness and fruit notes. Taste is similar with a good tingle in the mouth and tropical, grapefruit notes.</p>

<p>Not Today Clear golden with tight white head. Some fruity hops in the aroma and taste. Drinkable but not as good as their single hop beers.</p>

<p>Tropical Blonde Clear golden with creamy, tight white head. Maybe some light tropical notes. Taste is bitter and dry, perhaps with grapefruit. Bitter finish. Drinkable but a bit one-dimensional</p>

<p>### Malvern Hills</p>

<p>Anniversary Green Copper with a thin, lacy head. Nicely hoppy (brewed with green hops). Very clean with some malt.</p>

<p>Priessnitz Plzen As the name suggests, this is quite lagery. Golden in colour with a white head. Not a huge amount of aroma, some malt. Flavour is sweet malt. Mouthfeel is a little thin, but still drinkable.</p>

<p>Trevor Jet black, very little tan head. Quite dry mouthfeel with a little sweet malt. Nicely rounded and very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Manchester Marble Brewery</p>

<p>1888 Ginger Stout Very dark black, small tan head. Smells of ginger and roast malt. Given that I‚Äôm not a great fan of ginger beers, this is drinkable, but seems a bit of a waste of stout.</p>

<p>Bitter Pale golden with a small white had.  Oddly light with a strong flowery hop bitterness in the finish. Not really a bitter, much more like a pale ale, and a decent one at that.</p>

<p>Chocolate Marble Very dark black, small tan head. Smells quite sweet with a little roast malt. Some bitterness in the mouth, maybe some dark chocolate. Organic and bottle conditioned.</p>

<p>Dobber Golden with a relatively large white, frothy head. Aroma has IPA hoppiness with a little light malt. Smells quite citrusy. Very drinkable, with lots off hop tang.</p>

<p>Lagonda IPA Very pale golden with almost rocky white head. Smells of earthy hops. Lots of bitterness and not a lot else, but a pretty good, clean IPA. Some sour notes in the aftertaste keep it interesting enough.</p>

<p>Lost Your Marbles Very dark with no head. Smells slightly sour with some sweetness. It‚Äôs supposed to taste like black forest gateaux. I sort of see where they‚Äôre coming from, but it‚Äôs just not very nice. Maybe if you‚Äôre really keen on sour cherry and chocolate.</p>

<p>Marble Dunkel Dark reddish-brown with a light tan head. Smells of roasted malt and dark fruit, especially raisins. Also some Christmas-pudding like aromas. Taste is quite sweet with toffee and some metallic notes. Has a slight, and welcome, bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Marble Weisen Hazy orange-golden with a tight white head. Smells quite sweet, with mango and a litle hops. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is slightly soapy with a little fruit, but not a huge amount else going on. Good hop bitterness in the finish saves it somewhat.</p>

<p>Pint Very pale golden with small, frothy white head. Light aroma of fruity hops. Taste is dominated by bitter hops, but very clean and drinkable.</p>

<p>Stouter Port Stout Pretty much black, with a creamy, slightly off-white head. Quite sweet with alcohol notes. Some burnt malt, roasted and associated bitterness. Could be a bit better balanced.</p>

<p>Tawny No. 5 Hazy brown with a small, slightly off-white head. Resinous hops and citrus in the aroma. Taste is grapefruit, pine and citrus hops. Lots of resin in the aftertaste, which is very long-lasting.</p>

<p>### Marble Arch</p>

<p>125 Imperial Russian Stout Very nearly black with bubbles of white head. Smells of dark fruit, port, roasted malt. Taste is roasted, bitter and sweet with a slight stickiness. Definitely hides the ABV well. Some tannins and peppery spice build. Very drinkable with spicy port undertones.</p>

<p>### Marston Moor</p>

<p>Matchlock Mild A dark mild. Smells of roasted malts. Full flavoured ‚Äì a fairly decent mild.</p>

<p>### Marstons</p>

<p>61 Deep Clear golden with virtually no head. Aroma is citrus and grass. Taste is similar with a bit of a tang. A bit unbalanced but fine.</p>

<p>Bass Similar to the draft version, but with a bit less head and a bit more fizz in the mouth.</p>

<p>Bass Golden in colour with a thick, almost smoothflow head. Smells quite fruity and floral. Taste is biscuity malt with some sweetness and floral hops.</p>

<p>Double Drop Burnt orange colour, some spicy hops in the nose, along with the expected malt. Starts dry on the palate, leading to some caramel sweetness. Long lasting hop dryness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>EPA Light golden with some fruity hops in the aroma. Taste is very refreshing with some citrus notes. An excellent summer session beer.</p>

<p>Mann‚Äôs Brown Ale Dark brown with a beige head. Aroma of malt, caramel and dark fruit. Taste is similar, quite sweet with fruit dominating. Not too fizzy. Bags of flavor for the ABV.</p>

<p>Old Empire Very pale, long, quenching finish after hops and citrus. Could possibly cope with a few more hops, but a very good beer.</p>

<p>Oyster Stout Almost completely black with faint red tinges. Off-white head. Smells woody with some subtle smokey notes and some dark soft fruit. Taste is very complex with some dark sugar sweetness, dark chocolate and a developing bitterness. Some carbonation, but very quaffable.</p>

<p>Pedigree Clear golden with a white head. Smells light with some sweetness. A bit of roasted malt and hops at the star. Finishes quite dry. Medium carbonation. Gets a bit dull.</p>

<p>Simply Dark Ale Dark brown with very small bubbles of tan head. Roasted, slightly dark fruit aromas. Tingly in the mouth. Roast malt, slightly sour and dry. OK.</p>

<p>Simply Golden Ale Clear golden. Not a huge amount of aroma or taste, but would be a decent session beer.</p>

<p>Simply IPA Quite dark golden with frothy bubbles of white head. Smells malty with some light hopping. Crisp and malty with some biscuit and creamy notes. Essentially a bitter rather than anything approaching an IPA. Perfectly drinkable though.</p>

<p>Strong Pale Ale Clear orange with a frothy white head and good lacing. Smells of fruit with flowery notes and caramel sweetness. Taste is similar, with some maltiness. The sweetness fades out to leave a bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Mashonistas</p>

<p>Atacama Brut IPA. Golden yellow with small white head. Lots of tropical fruit aromas. Dry and resinous with some fruit notes in the finish. Pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>Darc Almond Not milk stout (almond milk). Very dark. Smells and tastes quite sweet with some bitter notes. Thinner than I would have expected from the look.</p>

<p>Madame Geneva Yellow with bubbly white head. Smells sour with lemon notes. Clean and drinkable. Not as sour as some, which is a good thing. Gentle and a good intro to the style.</p>

<p>Reeses 2B Cheerful Imperial porter. Definite aroma of peanut butter. Also some coffee notes. Ferrero Roche? Pretty dry with those notes in the taste, too. Smooth and very drinkable. Definitely doesn‚Äôt taste like the ABV.</p>

<p>Slurple Haze Very hazy yellow, almost looks thick. Some dry hop aroma. Taste is pretty complex with bitterness and drying resin hops in the finish.</p>

<p>### Maxim</p>

<p>Double Maxim Dark copper with a slightly off-white head. Smells light, perhaps some malt and hops. Quite dry, but not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>### May Hill</p>

<p>Legend Dark golden. Slight soapiness to the taste. Not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>### Mayfields</p>

<p>Ducking Stool Golden colour with a small head. Strangely sour, seemingly not in a deliberate way. Some malt and then a hoppy dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>### McColl‚Äôs</p>

<p>Suma Amber/golden with a white head. Aroma has lots of citrus, with resinous hops. Taste is very similar, with light carbonation and a dry, bitter finish.</p>

<p>### McEwan‚Äôs</p>

<p>McEwan‚Äôs 70 Copper coloured with tight white head. Sweet malt and a little fruitiness. Decidedly average but drinkable.</p>

<p>### Meantime</p>

<p>Boadicea Single variety hopped golden ale. Pale golden. Light, fruity aroma.  Good hit of bitter hops with almost a gueuze sourness in the finish.  Really interesting and would be a great summer garden beer.</p>

<p>Coffee Porter Very fizzy when poured, looks like coke. Very dark, with a slight red tinge. Smells somewhat of roasted coffee, although there‚Äôs also some dark, bitter chocolate in there. Lighter body than I was expecting, perhaps a little too watery. Little fizz in the mouth either. Tastes of coffee, with as minerally/metallic tang, and a bit of malt sweetness. Long, slightly chalky finish.</p>

<p>Kikku Flavoured with shichimi. Golden with no head and little visible carbonation. Has a distinctive aroma, but hard to pin down. Clean with some aromatic hops and an interesting spiciness.</p>

<p>Meantime Chocolate Looks like slightly fizzy black coffee. Smells of chocolate biscuits and some burnt malt. Fizzy mouthfeel, but thin and bland. Some (fake) chocolate taste, plus a it of coffee.</p>

<p>Meantime IPA Surprisingly tame smell, lacking in the expected hoppy fruitiness. Definitely has the strength of an IPA, but without the bitter hops it tastes too strong. Quite drinkable, but not really an IPA.</p>

<p>Meantime Pale Ale Dark golden with no bubbles of carbonation or head. Doesn‚Äôt smell of a whole lot. Taste is clean and crisp with a little hop in the finish. Could do with coming in a bigger bottle.</p>

<p>Meantime Pilsner Light golden, with a few small bubbles and a white frothy head. Smells of light (crystal?) malt. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, with a little citrus. Aftertaste is all pils - clean lager with a little hops. Pretty good.</p>

<p>Salted Caramel Porter Medium brown. Loads of roast malts and some sweetness in the aroma. Taste is similar with hop bitterness and a reasonable amount of carbonation. Rich and quite sticky - a sipping, rather than quaffing beer.</p>

<p>### Merry Miner</p>

<p>Methane Dark golden with a very weird taste, almost an almond nuttiness. Distinct alcohol notes as well.</p>

<p>Mild Dark. Tastes and smells of a whole lot of not a lot. Some slight roast in the finish. Disappointingly bland.</p>

<p>Warwickshire‚Äôs Finest No, it‚Äôs really not. Light amber, pretty bland session beer.</p>

<p>### Mighty Hop</p>

<p>Wot Ho Ginger Ale Brewed using fresh ginger, so perhaps unsurprisingly smells and tastes of ginger. Nothing wrong with it, just not my kind of beer.</p>

<p>### Mikkeller</p>

<p>Amarillo Single Hop IPA Hazy, dark copper with a rocky white head. Smells very hoppy with some resin notes. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel but not as much hop in the taste as you‚Äôd expect from the aroma or the other Mikkeller single hop varieties. Almost buttery in flavour with a little bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Beer Geek Breakfast Jet black with a few foamy bubbles of brown head. Quite oily. Smells of roasted malt, coffee and alcohol notes. Initially quite a creamy mouthfeel. Rich coffee and dark chocolate in the mouth, along with lots of bitterness in the finish. Complex and well-balanced, but perhaps the finish is too harsh.</p>

<p>Beer Geek Brunch (Weasel) Pours black and oily with milk-chocolate coloured head, which vanishes pretty quickly. Smells of coffee, with some additional dryness. Smooth, full mouthfeel with definite coffee taste leading to a very nice bitterness in the finish. Very well-balanced and drinkable.</p>

<p>Black (Chinese character) Very black, as the name suggests, with a dark, tan head. Lots of dry, sweet, roasted malt. Very full mouthfeel, with an obviously very high ABV. Quite a sweet, sipping beer. One to share and to spend an evening with.</p>

<p>Black Hole (Cognac) Completely black with a large finger of bubbly, brown head. Smells slightly burnt with dark chocolate and cognac. Sweet honey with alcohol that goes into coffee noted and roasted malt. A log going on, but is well-balanced. An incredibly interesting and drinkable stout. Doesn‚Äôt taste anywhere near as strong as the ABV.</p>

<p>Centennial Single Hop IPA Dark golden with a patchy white head. Smells of resinous hops. Tastes similar, and indeed similar to the other Mikkeller single hops. On a par with the citra, but with a very different hop profile.</p>

<p>Citra Single Hop IPA Slightly hazy, dark bronze with a large, foamy white head. Lots of hops in the aroma, with lemon curd notes. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, with lots of bitterness and a light grapefruit tartness in the finish. Also some tropical fruit in there.</p>

<p>Drinkin‚Äô in the Sun Hazy golden yellow with tight white head. Smells and tastes of citra style hops with plenty of grapefruit, especially in the finish. Also some sweetness. I really wouldn‚Äôt guess this was low alcohol.</p>

<p>Green Gold Dark copper. Nose is all hops with a good mix of resin and elderflower aromas. Nicely balanced, and definitely very hoppy, IPA. Another very good Mikkeller beer that just works.</p>

<p>Mikkeller Weizenbock Copper with a white head that leaves good lacing. Smells of wheat, yeast and alcohol. Very full mouthfeel with definite alcohol notes. Definitely a bock. Some hops in the finish.</p>

<p>Nelson Sauvin Single Hop IPA Brewed at De Proef, Belgium. Dark amber with a small, fluffy white head. Smells of grapefruit and a little light malt. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Plenty of grapefruit, with the associated dry, tingly bitterness in the mouth. Some spice notes as well. An excellent IPA, more American in style than you‚Äôd predict from two European breweries.</p>

<p>The American Dream Copper with frothy white head. Nose and taste both have lots of citrus, bitter hops. A bit one dimensional, but very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Milestone</p>

<p>American IPA Clear golden, with very fine streams of carbonation but very little head. Tastes quite flat and thin with some resinous hops in the finish. Also some off-putting hints of metal.</p>

<p>Black Pearl Very dark with a frothy head. Smells of roasted malts and has a similar flavour, with the addition of some coffee notes. Some dry bitterness which contrasts nicely. Very smooth mouthfeel, which turns a bit dry towards the end. Quaffable!</p>

<p>Lions Pride Hazy golden with no bubbles and very little head. Smells salty and sour like a jar of capers. Some fruit in the background and lambic-like notes with vinegar and bitterness. Not disgusting nor offensive, but I really have no desire to drink it.</p>

<p>Somer Wheat Beer Golden in colour. A continental-style wheat beer with a good, zingy finish.</p>

<p>### Milk Street Brewery</p>

<p>Cobble Wobble Light copper with a creamy head. Smells of must and malt. Quite fizzy, tastes like stilton. Weird.</p>

<p>### Mill St. Brewery</p>

<p>Vanilla Porter Very dark with a creamy white head. Smells of chocolately roasted malt. VEry creamy with lots of roast malt and a hint of vanilla, but it‚Äôs not overpowering. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Moa Brewing Company</p>

<p>Festive Red IPA Reddish copper with white head. Smells of bitter hops. Very clean tasting with some resin in the finish.</p>

<p>Moa Methode Clear golden with a tight white head that lasts well. Grainy notes in the aroma. Lots of flavour, but it‚Äôs a bit dirty with a weird chemically finish.</p>

<p>Original Lager Very dark for a lager - copper coloured. Very little aroma. Clean and slightly spicy taste. Very drinkable. Some grainy malt in the finish.</p>

<p>### Mondo Brewing</p>

<p>Pinche Guey Amber lager. Fizzy. Clean and crisp. It‚Äôs basically an American adjunct lager.</p>

<p>### Mongozo</p>

<p>Mongozo (Coconut) I generally don‚Äôt do fruit beers, but this was weird enough to warrant trying. Cloudy yellow with a little head. Unsurprisingly smells of coconut, with some sweet creamy notes. Tates a lot like I‚Äôd expect fermented coconut milk to. Quite refreshing and clean. I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>Mongozo (Mango) Light, slightly hazy golden with no fizz and a rapidly-vanishing head. Apricot aroma. Very sweet, and tastes more like peach/apricot than mango. Very sticky, and too sweet. Really not very good.</p>

<p>Mongozo (Palmnut) Copper, slightly cloudy with a tan head. Smells like orange jelly. Sweet and fruity with alcohol notes. Complex with some spicing, but surprisingly little aftertaste. Does a lot, but is a bit weird. Apparently based on an Angolan beer.</p>

<p>### Monteith‚Äôs</p>

<p>Black Beer Smells of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee. Tastes of similar. Very drinkable and not too fizzy.</p>

<p>Double Hopped IPA Lots of hop aroma. Some bitterness and resin hops in the taste, but also quite a lot of alcohol.</p>

<p>Golden Lager Yeah, it‚Äôs pretty much a lager with some fizz and a little sweetness and hops in the taste.</p>

<p>IPA Fruity hop aroma which is also in the taste. Well balanced by malt and a good level of bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Imperial Pilsner Clear golden with white head. Crisp and refreshing with some fruit notes.</p>

<p>Original Ale Some sweetness with a hint of fruit (blackberry?). Very drinkable but nothing overwhelmingly exciting.</p>

<p>Velvet Stout Pretty much black with small tan head. Smells and tastes of cocoa, with a building bitterness. Not entirely as smooth as the name suggests - some tingle and a little thin in the mouthfeel.</p>

<p>### Monty‚Äôs</p>

<p>Masquerade Gluten free. Golden with citrus aroma. Taste is dominated by tropical fruits, but also a slightly odd vegetable note. Drinkable.</p>

<p>### Moor</p>

<p>Brit Hop Golden with tight white head. Loads of resinous hops. Good mix of fruit (tropical) and some bitterness. Very drinkable and interesting.</p>

<p>Hoppiness Dark golden with lots of resinous hops in both the taste and aroma. A bit one dimensional.</p>

<p>Nor‚ÄôHop pale golden, slightly hazy with a frothy white head. Smells very hoppy. Taste is crisp with plenty of hop grass and resin notes. Lightly carbonated, very refreshing and a slight citrus aftertaste makes a very nice beer garden beer.</p>

<p>Norther Star Pale golden with a bubbly white head and large bubbles of carbonation. Smells of citrus and tropical fruit hops. Fizz in the mouth along with more, clean and fruity hops with some light sweetness. Very refreshing.</p>

<p>Riders Revival Hazy golden with tight white head. Fruity hops in the aroma and taste. Slight bitterness in the finish. Very drinkable - excellent session beer.</p>

<p>### Moorhouse</p>

<p>Black Cat Dark brown/ruby with a large foamy tan head. Smells roasted, with chocolate and coffee notes and a hint of spice. Rich, roasted, some sweetness and roast malt dominates the lingering finish. Not too heavy. Excellently flavoured, and a very good mild.</p>

<p>Blond Witch Straw blond with a white, foamy head and good lacing. Smells of citrus hops. Some sweet malt followed by a citrus dryness.</p>

<p>Pendle Witches Brew Golden with a frothy head. Smells slightly sweet with light malt. Mouthfeel is slightly fizzy, but the taste is crisp with a reasonable balance of hops and sweetness.</p>

<p>Spring Watch Golden with tight white head. Citrus hop aroma. Surprisingly malty with grassy hops. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Moosehead Breweries</p>

<p>Moosehead Lager Straw coloured with plenty of carbonation and a frothy, tight white head. Smells slightly fruity and tart. Very fizzy mouthfeel with some light bitterness and a dryish finish. Pretty interesting for a lager.</p>

<p>### Mordue</p>

<p>Northumbrian Blonde Golden with a white, bubbly head. Aroma has lots of grapefruit hops. Taste us similar; nicely crisp with a good lingering hop finish. Would be an excellent summer session beer.</p>

<p>Workie Ticket Mid brown with tight head that leaves good lacing. Smells rich and slightly sour. Lots going on with dark fruit leading to a slightly bitter finish. Very smooth and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Moreton</p>

<p>Essington IPA A pale golden IPA. Not overly powerful but sufficient hops make this very nicely drinkable.</p>

<p>### Morgans</p>

<p>Churchill‚Äôs Best Mid-brown with a frothy head. Smells of light malt. Slightly toasted sweetness with a little hop dryness in the finish.</p>

<p>Merryvale Lad Dark copper, with very little head. Some malt and a slightly spicy toffee sweetness. Ok, but nothing overly exciting. Hobgoblin-lite.</p>

<p>Metallica A decent although uninspiring bitter with plenty of malt.</p>

<p>### Morrisey Fox</p>

<p>Aussie IPA Golden and cloudy with very little head, just some scummy froth. A little lacing. Doesn‚Äôt smell good at all. Very dirty. Some bitterness with an incredibly sour aftertaste. Very thin with a metallic mouthfeel. A truly awful attempt.</p>

<p>### Mount St. Bernard Abbey Brewery</p>

<p>Tynt Meadow Dark reddish with a creamy head. Strong aroma of dark fruit with some alcohol notes. Quite fizzy mouthfeel. Chocolate sweetness with more dark fruit. Slightly spicy finish. Slightly sticky. Definitely more of a strong English ale than a Belgian one.</p>

<p>### Mr Majolica</p>

<p>Enterprise Dominated by dry hops and slight alcohol notes.</p>

<p>### Muckle Brewing</p>

<p>Whin Sill Blonde Golden with streams of carbonation and a fine white head. Caramel and sweet biscuit aroma. Taste is bitter with a sharp, tingly finish that reminds me of grapefruit. Slightly sour, too. It‚Äôs ok, but nothing special.</p>

<p>### Murphy Brewery</p>

<p>Murphy‚Äôs Irish Stout Very black, with creamy white head. Smells of bready malt with some sweet and roasted notes. Tastes smooth, malty and relatively light for a stout. I actually prefer this to Guinness, it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs not more widely available. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Navigation</p>

<p>Icebreaker Pale golden with tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some hop bitterness but not overly exciting.</p>

<p>Navigation Golden Golden with light fruit and malt in the aroma. Taste is very clean, with a medium mouthfeel with some biscuity malt and hops in the finish, which keeps it interesting and refreshing. Would be a very good session beer.</p>

<p>Navigation Traditional Amber coloured. Smooth and malty in the mouth. Well-balanced malt and hops, but mainly malt, especially in the very smooth finish.</p>

<p>### Naylor‚Äôs Brewery</p>

<p>Pinnacle Blonde Golden with a large white head. Aroma is mostly hops and fruit, Some bitterness but not overly exciting, could be a good summer session beer, especially if served a bit cooler.</p>

<p>Scrooge Bright golden with fine bubbles of white head. Nice balance of hops and light malt with a good, dry finish on the side of the tongue. Very drinkable; this could be a dangerous session beer.</p>

<p>Winters‚Äô T‚Äôale Dark golden with tight bubbles of white head. Smells slightly sweet, malty and spicy. A bit thin, but enough bitterness to keep it drinkable.</p>

<p>### Nelson</p>

<p>### Neon Raptor</p>

<p>Hippo Launcher Hazy orange with a small white head. Smells of tropical fruit and citrus. Taste is similar, with a lingering fruit sweetness. A very decent beer, and certainly way too drinkable for the ABV.</p>

<p>### Nethergate Brewery</p>

<p>Umbel Ale Brewed with whole leaf hops and coriander. Copper-coloured with a small, frothy head. Smells of what it‚Äôs brewed with. Nice hoppy bitterness and a little spice, along with sufficient malt to keep it well-rounded.</p>

<p>### Newmans</p>

<p>Druids Choice Bronze in colour, with little aroma, perhaps some lemon and malt. Light mouthfeel with a dry finish. Overall quite subtle but very drinkable.</p>

<p>Silver Standard Pale golden with a slight citrus aroma. Taste has some dryness with grain notes, and is nicely clean.</p>

<p>### Nobby‚Äôs</p>

<p>Nobby‚Äôs Best Very little aroma, perhaps a touch of hops. Reasonably bland butter with a slight hoppy aftertaste. A little dull.</p>

<p>T‚ÄôOld Navigation A dark ruby beer, smells slightly sour and of hops. Taste is a little sour, very reminiscent of an oud brune. Sourness isn‚Äôt overpowering, well balanced by the malts. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Nomad</p>

<p>Oasis Slightly cloudy, witbier-like in appearance. Frothy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Nice, clean taste with a slightly tingly mouthfeel and a little bitter hop. Very nice session beer.</p>

<p>Honey Stout Brewed with Cotswald honey. Dark, with weird burnt/sour notes in the taste. No real honey in evidence.</p>

<p>Hung Drawn ‚Äòn‚Äô Portered Very dark, no head. Smells sour, which is also the initial taste. More hops than you‚Äôd expect from a porter.</p>

<p>Winter Solstice Very dark with a tan head. Smells of roasted malts, but has a much milder taste than you‚Äôd expect from the appearance. Small amount of roast malts with some bitterness. Very drinkable, but less exciting than I was hoping.</p>

<p>### Northern Monk / Evil Twin</p>

<p>Even More Death Very, very dark with tan head. Sweet aroma with dark chocolate, roasted malt and obvious alcohol notes (unsurprisingly). Mouthfeel is oily. Taste is sweet with more chocolate and possibly coconut. Definitely a sipping beer, but very indulgent.</p>

<p>### Nottingham Brewery</p>

<p>Extra Pale Ale Very pale with large, bubbly white head. SMells very hoppy, with both citrus and grassy/bitter aromas. Sharp bitter hops dominate the taste and last well. Very crisp and refreshing with a nicely balanced finish.</p>

<p>### N√∏gne √ò</p>

<p>Brown Ale Dark brown with tight, creamy off-white head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Taste is all about roasted malt with some nuttiness. Very smooth and easy-drinking.</p>

<p>N√∏gne √ò #100 Black, with a slightly off-white head. Roasted malt, dark fruit, sweetness and alcohol notes come together in the aroma. Taste has more dark fruit with a dryness and a bitter finish. Alcohol warmth builds slowly, along with some stickiness.</p>

<p>N√∏gne √ò God Jul Very black with a creamy tan head. Smells of roasted malt with dark fruit, a little smoke and alcohol notes. Massively full of flavour with roast malts, some slightly sweet, dark fruit and a good hit of smoke in the finish. Surprisingly creamy with just a hint of tingle on the tongue. A very nice beer.</p>

<p>N√∏gne √ò Imperial Stout Pitch black with a brown head. Lots of roast malt, along with balancing amounts of sweetness and bitterness. Slight fizz in the mouth, with plenty of roasted flavours and significant bitterness. Very nice.</p>

<p>N√∏gne √ò India Pale Ale Smells very hoppy. Large, frothy white head. Tastes of fruity hops with some bitterness and strawberry/other soft fruit. A nice, lingering bitterness keeps it very drinkable.</p>

<p>N√∏gne √ò Pale Ale Slightly hazy copper with a tight white head which has good lacing. Some burnt sweetness with definite farmyard notes. Hoppy in the American style, but not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>N√∏gne √ò Wit Hazy golden with a finger of tight, yet frothy white head. Smells like a Belgian wit, with lemony citrus and some yeast. Clean, crust and not too much fizz. Very much like the Vedett white. Definitely drinkable.</p>

<p>Two Captains IPA Cloudy, dark copper with thing head and good lacing. Smells of resinous hops. Smooth and full mouthfeel. Good American-style hopping with flowery and resinous notes, which stad out in the finish. Worryingly drinkable.</p>

<p>### Oakham</p>

<p>American Pale Ale Brewed for Morrison‚Äôs. This is a very nice, clean and sharp US-style pale ale. Dominated by hop bitterness, especially in the finish. Some bittersweet and biscuit notes and a massively long finish.</p>

<p>Bishops Farewell Very light with a frothy head. Strange, unidentifiable smell, perhaps toast and jam. Mild hop bitterness with a touch of fruit. The hops give it a lingering, refreshing dryness.</p>

<p>Great Gustav Pale golden with tight white head. Taste and aroma are both zesty hops with some fruit and floral notes. Very, very drinkable with a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>Green Devil IPA Clear golden with a slightly frothy, white head. Huge aroma of tropical fruit hops. Taste is similar, complex yet clean with an initial tropical fruit flavour followed by a tart, lingering grapefruit finish.</p>

<p>JHB AKA Jeffrey Hudson Bitter. Clear golden colour with a frothy white head. Smells of lemon with some sweet floral tinges. Flavour is similar, with a bitter, somewhat drying finish. Pretty nice session beer.</p>

<p>Oakham Citra Golden with a slightly hazy, bubbly white head. Aroma of citrus (grapefruit) hops with some floweriness. Not too strongly hopped, with fruitiness and a lingering grapefruit dryness. Surprisingly subtle for a single-hop ale, which serves to make it very drinkable.</p>

<p>Scarlet Macaw Dark copper. Smells of fruity, dry hops. Clean and hoppy with a nice dryness and good levels of hopping.</p>

<p>White Dwarf Surprisingly clear for a weissbier, maybe filtered. Pale with a small white head. Little aroma, but a very pleasing citrus/hop dryness and bitterness. Very drinkable, smooth and refreshing. Perhaps a little undercarbonated, but it‚Äôs a cask ale so I shouldn‚Äôt really complain.</p>

<p>### Odell Brewing Company</p>

<p>5 Barrel Pale Ale Pale golden with a small white head with good lacing. Smells of resinous hops. Not too fizzy, just enough to be crisp. Good balance of hops, dominated by resin flavours. Drying finish with a hint of smoke.</p>

<p>Cutthroat Porter Jet black with a thin tan head. Roast coffee notes and some burnt aromas. Quite a drying mouthfeel with some tartness. Quite a thin body, could do with a bit more. Other than that it‚Äôs fine.</p>

<p>Oldell‚Äôs 90/- Lightly hazy copper colour with slightly off-white head. Smells malty with a very sinus-clearing almost minty kick. Sine fizz, and not a huge amount of initial taste, although a little spice comes through. Dry, fruity and spicy finish with a little caramel.</p>

<p>St. Lupulin Golden. Lots of resin and tannin hop flavour. Pretty crisp and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Okanagan Spring Brewery</p>

<p>### Old Dominion Brewing Company</p>

<p>Cherry Blossom Lager Copper colour with tight white head. Smells grainy. Taste quite bitter and not that well rounded. Some flowery hop notes.</p>

<p>Hop Mountain Hazy golden with a very small head. Smells hoppy and well-balanced. Taste is full and malty with hop undertones, leading to a nice, drying hop finish. Fruity rather than massively resinous hops.</p>

<p>Oak Barrel Stout Jet black with a small, tan head. Lots of roast coffee notes. Very smooth with some bitternes and spice, along with some tannins from the barrel ageing. Slightly astringent finish. Can‚Äôt really taste the vanilla that‚Äôs meant to be in it, but it‚Äôs certainly no loss.</p>

<p>Otter Ale VDark amber with small but lasting head. Smell is subtle, taste is quite smooth, initially with fruits (pear/raisin) and then a little hop bitterness.</p>

<p>Otter Amber Actually more golden in colour. Hop aroma and taste, with a bitter finish. Nice light session beer.</p>

<p>Otter Bitter Clear golden/amber with a nice white head. Smells of malt with some grass notes. Exceptionally drinkable, clean with enough malt and a mild bitterness to keep it interesting. This one goes down very quickly.</p>

<p>Otter Bright Very light for a bitter, apparently made with lager malts. Light in colour with a few bubbles and a small, quickly vanishing white head. Floral and citrus aroma with some hops. Very well balanced, malts and hops work well together. A tangy bitter. Fantastic in hot weather, understated but brilliant.</p>

<p>### Palmers</p>

<p>Dorset Gold Clear golden-yellow with a frothy head. Mild flavour with some summery fruits and light malt. Also has a little sweetness. Generally an ok beer.</p>

<p>### Panhead</p>

<p>Pilsner Pale golden with white head. Grassy and citrus aroma. Clean with a pleasant bitterness. Very, very drinkable.</p>

<p>The Vandal Golden with bubbly white head. Resin and fruit hops in the aroma. Maybe pineapple. Good hop hit in the taste leading to a lingering dryness and tropical fruit. Very nice. A proper (US-style) IPA.</p>

<p>### Paulaner Brauerei</p>

<p>Munchner Hell Very pale yellow with small white head. Smells like a typical helles with grain and some sweetness, very clean.  Taste is also clean and smooth with light malt and a slightly spicy and lemon citrus finish. Very nice.</p>

<p>Oktoberfest Small amount of head. Much less fizzy and a lot more taste than the others. Well rounded, but a bit minerally, with a little dryness. Biscuity malt and dry citrus/apple in the finish.</p>

<p>Salvator Definitely a doppelbock. Hazy golden with no head. Dark druid and sweet alcohol (and plums?) in the aroma. Malt and alcohol in the taste, with a sticky, sugary sweetness. Doesn‚Äôt really do enough for the ABV.</p>

<p>### Peerless</p>

<p>Full Whack Copper with no head. Smells and tastes pretty sweet. It‚Äôs fine, but really not very interesting and too sweet for me.</p>

<p>Hilbre Gold Clear golden. Smells malty and sweet. Honey/caramel sweetness with some biscuity malt. A bit generic but pretty drinkable. Quite a dry finish keeps it reasonably interesting.</p>

<p>### Penzance</p>

<p>Scilly Stout Essentially black in colour. Smells quite chocolatey, very thick. Dry, with some sweetness and a nice level of bitterness in the finish. Alcohol is noticeable, so definitely not a session beer.</p>

<p>### Peroni</p>

<p>Gran Riserva Slightly red golden beer with a good head. Some hops in the aroma. Taste is quite biscuity with a hop finish. It‚Äôs better than the Nastro Azzuro, but not enough to justify the extra money.</p>

<p>Nastro Azzuro Average continental lager, very pale and not too fizzy. It‚Äôs quite drinkable, but probably only if you‚Äôre in Pizza Express and there‚Äôs nothing else.</p>

<p>### Phoenix</p>

<p>Black Bee Porter Dark brown. Smells slightly sweet (contains honey). Quite fizzy so not too smooth. Ok, but not great.</p>

<p>Double Gold Smells slightly dirty with some caramel notes. Taste would be similar, except there‚Äôs a huge amount of bitterness with a strong, lingering sour finish. May be worth trying again.</p>

<p>Wobbly Bob Clear, reddish brown with a faint white head. Smells sweet with bready notes, almost butterscotch. Very sweet for a bitter, with toffee and a hint of hops in the finish. Surprising and surprisingly drinkable - the hops just about balance the sweetness.</p>

<p>Vienna Pale Unfiltered hazy orange with small white head. Not much else going on, perhaps a bit of malt and sweetness in the finish. A good summer session beer.</p>

<p>### Pivzavod Baltika</p>

<p>Baltika 3 Pale golden with thin white lacing. Some fruit notes with a little hop. Very light body and not much taste. Generic.</p>

<p>Baltika 7 Export Pale lager with a good finger of head when poured into a small glass. Little aroma or carbonation. Slight tingle in the mouth, but smooth and drinkable. Mellow and refreshing, not a lot going on in the taste, perhaps a little sweetness.</p>

<p>### Port Brewing</p>

<p>Old Viscosity Very dark with tan head. Dark, roasted, spicy. Very rich with alcohol notes. A building bitterness. Pretty good but maybe not worth the ABV.</p>

<p>### Porterhouse Brewing Company</p>

<p>Hop Head Golden with a frothy white head and fine streams of carbonations. Strong hop aroma with bitterness and some floral notes. Tingly with a nice level of hopping which leaves a slight, but lingering aftertaste. A nice introduction to US-style pale ales / IPAs from Ireland.</p>

<p>### Potbelly Brewery</p>

<p>Beijing Black Dark black with a frothy white head, which lingers with good lacing. Smells of roasted malts with some chocolate sweetness. Very smooth with roasted malts, and then a little hop bitterness to make it interesting. Slightly sweet aftertaste, but incredibly clean and drinkable. A very nice mild.</p>

<p>### Pratt Street Ale House</p>

<p>Oliver‚Äôs Blonde Hazy golden with a white head that has good retention (pitcher). Smells quite sweet with grain notes and a little hop bitterness. More hop dryness that I expected, but that makes it quite refreshing. Not bad, but nothing stellar.</p>

<p>Oliver‚Äôs Dark Horse Dark chestnut brown with small tan head (served in a pitcher). Smells of roasted malts with light hops and some bitterness. Tastes similar, although it‚Äôs quite thin. Slightly tingly carbonation.</p>

<p>### Pressure Drop</p>

<p>Wu Gang Chops The Tree Foraged herb hefeweissen. Slightly hazy orange with a small, tight white head. Herby, slightly menthol/aniseed aroma. Taste is quite odd. It‚Äôs quite flat, with biscuity notes and some unusual herb/vegetable notes.</p>

<p>Frankenheim Alt Very dark brown with a scummy white head. Small streams of light carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma, some burnt/roast notes. Fizzy, with similar burnt notes in the mouth as well as some disinfectant. Weird aftertaste and not very nice.</p>

<p>### Privatbrauerei Ketterer</p>

<p>Pure Gold Clear golden with finger of white head, which leaves some lacing. Aroma is dominated by floral hops, no real bitterness. Plenty of hops, both fruity and dry/bitter. Very good session beer.</p>

<p>### Redwillow</p>

<p>Ageless A double IPA. Slightly hazy copper with a large, frothy white head. Smells of resinous American hops. Taste is very, very hoppy with lots of bitterness and strong resin notes in the finish. A definite sipping beer, but a very nice one at that.</p>

<p>Fathomless An oyster stout. Jet black, with no light getting through at all. No visible carbonation or head. Smells malty with some tang (perhaps brine?) and sweet, with notes of dark fruit. Rich and full with a little sweetness and a roasted, bitter finish which lasts well. Something else as well, possibly ozone notes.</p>

<p>Feckless Copper with a white, frothy head. Smells sour. Taste is malt with some fix in the mouth, but quite sweet and the smell is off-putting.</p>

<p>Headless Golden with fine streams of carbonation with a very large, white head (I suspect that the name is ironic). Smells hoppy with floral notes. Quite fizzy with plenty of hops. Clean a drinkable. A nicely refreezing beer that you could drink all day.</p>

<p>Wreckless Hazy copper-gold with lots of sediment. Smells of fruity hops. Taste has citrus bitterness with orange notes. Very clean and drinkable, would be a great beer-garden refresher, with enough hops to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>Dizzy Blonde Pale golden with a froth of white head. Smells of hops (possibly amarillo). Taste is also hoppy, backed up by malt with a citrus, fruity and dry finish. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Rogue Brewery</p>

<p>John John Dead Guy Ale Cloudy orange with small white head. Very strong nose with apricot and warm spices. Taste is well-rounded with some sweetness, malt and a little hops.</p>

<p>Juniper Ale Hazy golden with a small, creamy white head. Slightly odd aroma, which could be juniper, but not sure. Taste is similarly different, but quite nice. Not too much fizz. Clean and drinkable.</p>

<p>Mocha Porter Very dark with a small, slightly tan head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Quite tingly in the mouth. Some roasted malts leading to a drying, bitter finish.</p>

<p>Shakespeare Stout At 8 a (large) bottle, I was hoping for something special and this didn‚Äôt disappoint! Has been World Stout Champion, and it‚Äôs clear why. Pours jet black, with a creamy brown (darker than tan) head, which lasts well. Smells of hops and spices, with a hint of burnt coffee. Creamy, but not as full a mouthfeel as some stouts. Contrasts with the pour, which is surprisingly fizzy. Very well rounded, with roasted malts and a nicely balancing bitter, dry aftertaste from the hops. Some berry notes. Surprisingly clean for a stout, which leads to it being incredibly drinkable.</p>

<p>St. Rogue Red Ale Copper/dark brown with a light brown, tight head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some bittersweet notes leading to a dry, almost powdery finish. Needs another drink to go with it; much like a dry cider. Some fruit notes appear as it warms up a bit. Interesting, but I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd want to drink a whole one.</p>

<p>Yellow Snow Hazy golden with a white, frothy head and good lacing. Strong aroma of resinous hops. Flavour is similar with resin and some mustiness, and a lingering bitterness in the finish. Not at all subtle, but a good hit of hops. Definitely a US-style IPA.</p>

<p>### Roosters</p>

<p>Capability Brown It‚Äôs a bitter. Reddish-brown with a creamy white head. Bittersweet taste and aroma. Quite earthy.</p>

<p>### Roseland</p>

<p>Cornish Shag Very pale. Smells vegetable. Slightly fizzy and very dull.</p>

<p>### Rothammer</p>

<p>Nazca IPA Golden with no real head and little visible carbonation. Malt and light citrus aroma. Pretty clean with some nice carbonation in the mouth and a lingering hop finish.</p>

<p>### Rotters</p>

<p>Misty Mountain Golden with a bit of fizz. Clean and very drinkable, with a nice balance of sweet malt and hop bitterness. Like a helles without the fizz.</p>

<p>### Rudgate</p>

<p>Hop on Board Very fruity aroma with quite a lot of berry sweetness. Quite full mouthfeel with a mix of bitterness and light malt. Lingering, bitter finish</p>

<p>Match Pint Medium brown colour. Smells a bit dirty, with some fruity hop aromas. Taste is similar, but a lot cleaner. Generally ok and drinkable.</p>

<p>Viking Golden with foamy white head. Malty and bittersweet. Pretty average.</p>

<p>### SA Brain</p>

<p>Brain‚Äôs Party Popper Dark copper with a small white head. Smells slightly malty, but not a lot happening. Tastes quite sweet with a little fruit. Not as full as I‚Äôd expect from a winter ale. Reminiscent of a half-decent homebrew.</p>

<p>Brain‚Äôs SA Dark copper with a creamy head. Large roasted malt flavour. Quite smooth but a bit dull.</p>

<p>Spill the Beans Very dark red with bubbles of tan head. Lots of coffee in the aroma and taste. Also quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Some sweetness and a slight dryness in the finish. A decent coffee beer.</p>

<p>### SNAB</p>

<p>Pale Ale Golden with white head that leaves lots of lacing. Good hop character in the aroma. Similar in the taste. Worryingly drinkable‚Ä¶</p>

<p>### Sadlers</p>

<p>Drop ‚ÄòO the Black Stuff Very black, as the name suggests. Tight tan head. Smells of roasted malt. Tastes like a porter should, with roasted malt and a little coffee, although it‚Äôs much lighter in body than I‚Äôd have expected. Enough going on to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>Jack‚Äôs Pale Ale Very pale. Aroma and taste are both all hops, but in a nicely balanced way. Some crisp citrus in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>Mud City Stout Very black in colour. Rich and full-bodied, with some wheatiness giving a smooth palate. Brewed with raw cocoa, but not really that noticeable beyond the roasted aftertaste.</p>

<p>Peaky Blinder Pale golden with a hoppy and fruity aroma with a bit of malt. Not a huge amount going on - some hop bitterness and citrus zest. Very drinkable and not too fizzy.</p>

<p>Red IPA Red in colour. Smells of resinous hops and mango. Taste is similar with a lovely hoppy, bitter, dry and resinous finish. A very nice US-style IPA.</p>

<p>Stumbling Badger Copper coloured, with a thick white head. Very little aroma (although that could be because of the head). Creamy mouthfeel, but not a huge amount of taste beyond some malt.</p>

<p>Thin Ice Pale golden. Smells fruity, possibly orange. Clean with sweetness, malt and a bitter finish.</p>

<p>Worcester Sorcerer Golden with small white head. Smells a little odd with malt and a strange sweetness. Wire fizzy. Sweet with not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>### Saint Archer</p>

<p>Saint Archer Pale Ale Golden with creamy white head. Citrus and pine notes in the aroma. Taste is similar with some resin hops which linger in the finish. A very drinkable pale ale bordering on an IPA.</p>

<p>### Salamander</p>

<p>Golden Salamander Pretty bland, but inoffensive. Some hop bitterness and citrus notes. A good session beer, but nothing stands out.</p>

<p>### Salopian</p>

<p>Aphelion Very dark with just off-white head. Loads of hop aroma with tropical fruit. Very smooth with a good balance of hops and a bitter, fruity finish.</p>

<p>Blackwater Baroque Clear golden, smells of citrus hops. Nice citrus tang in the mouth, very clean and refreshing all the way to the finish. Plenty of hops of all kinds - citrus, bitter, peppery spice.</p>

<p>Darwin‚Äôs Original Light copper with a frothy white head. Smells quite bitter with plenty of hops. Taste is good hop bitterness, very clean, with some resin notes in the finish, which lingers well. A typically good Salopian beer.</p>

<p>Dead Drop Pale golden with very tight white head. Lots of tropical fruit hops in the aroma. Clean and exceedingly drinkable. Passion fruit hops and some bitterness. Very, very good session beer. Perfect fit a beer garden in the sun.</p>

<p>Firkin Freezin‚Äô Copper with a large, frothy white head. Tastes dry and bitter with some malt and a medium body. Very drinkable, especially for what I first took to be a novelty seasonal beer.</p>

<p>Hop Twister Clear golden with a frothy white head. Smells very hoppy, with plenty of bitterness. Tastes similar with good bitterness and some fruit to round it out. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Kashmir Golden with bubbles of white head. Citrus and tropical fruit in the aroma, certainly plenty of hops. Quite thin in the mouth, but plenty of flavour; more hops with both fruit and some drying bitterness, especially in the finish. Very lingering finish. Nothing amazingly new, but it does it so well. A great example of an IPA, and incredibly drinkable.</p>

<p>Lemon Dream Pale in colour, some wheat and citrus in the aroma. Very clean and drinkable. Could be a very nice summer session beer.</p>

<p>Oracle Light blonde, with a creamy white head, which has good retention and lacing. Smells of floral hops, along with citrus. Low carbonation, with a bitter, refreshing hoppiness. Could (and indeed, did) drink this all night.</p>

<p>### Saltaire</p>

<p>Hazelnut Coffee Porter Dark red with a small, tan head. Strong roast coffee and hazelnut syrup aroma. Slight fizz, nut very rich with nut notes and a slightly bitter finish. Actually ends up with quire a creamy mouthfeel.</p>

<p>Pacifica IPA Amber with a foamy white head. Aroma has light hop notes. Mouthfeel is clean and smooth. Slightly mixed flavour with citrus fruits and some sweetness. Ok, but a little bit off-key. Decent bitter finish though.</p>

<p>Raspberry Blonde Bright golden, smells of raspberry, which is a good start considering the name. Good tingle in the mouth, but not a whole lot of flavour. Very light with a slight raspberry bitterness in the finish. Would be a nice beer garden beer on a hot day.</p>

<p>Saltaire Blonde Golden with no head and a little carbonation. Smells a bit dirty with light malt. Quite creamy, with some sweet malt. Drinkable, but a bit uninspired.</p>

<p>Saltaire Cascade Dark golden with no fizz but a thick white head. Smells very hoppy. Taste also has a good level of hopping with a refreshing, lingering bitterness. Well balanced, you could drink a lot of this.</p>

<p>### Sambrooks</p>

<p>Powerhouse Porter Very dark brown. Small off-white head. Relatively creamy, but not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>Wandle Golden amber. Malt dominates the aroma. Bittersweet, with more sweetness in the finish. it‚Äôs OK, but nothing special.</p>

<p>### Samuel Smiths Old Brewery</p>

<p>Double Four Lager Pale golden with small bubbles of white head. Smells malty and sweet. Just a bit dull.</p>

<p>Extra Stout Jet black with very tight, creamy white head. Rich and smooth and very drinkable. Some slight bitterness in the finish. Surprisingly light.</p>

<p>Organic Cherry Beer Very red, smells of morello cherries and almonds. No head. Reminds me of cherryade, with a little added dryness. Cherry drops with a metallic ending.</p>

<p>Organic Lager Very pale gold with a little carbonation, but very little head. Some clean citrus smell, with a bit of malt. Similar taste, with some dryness on the sides of the tongue. Malt in the aftertaste, pretty drinkable but a bit unexciting.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Alpine Lager Smells a lot like a helles, with sweetness and light malt. Tastes slightly sweet and has a lingering lagerish aftertaste, but is a good summer beer.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Imperial Stout Almost black with a tan head which has fairly good retention. Smell is sweet caramel with roasted malts. Bittersweet taste with bitter chocolate and sweet caramel, backed up by roasted malts. Nicely full mouthfeel. Some slight alcohol notes in the finish. The only reason this doesn‚Äôt get 5 is because the Oatmeal Stout is out of this world.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs India Ale Copper with a fine white head. Smells of tart hops. Taste is quite dry and crisp, with moderate carbonation and plenty of hops. Some caramel sweetness, but hops dominate the finish.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Nut Brown Ale Pale brown in colour (think Newcastle Brown), very clear with little head. Smells sweet, with a distinct nuttiness. Genuinely tastes of nuts, along with some sweetness and mild hops. Tingles on the tongue, but not unpleasantly so. A good brown ale, but for some reason not very exciting.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Oatmeal Stout Very dark with a large tan head which lingers nicely. Aroma is complex, dominated by roasted malts and a notable oat smell (porridge?), some sweet caramel and bitter chocolate, also some hops. Tastes very dark, with notable oatiness. A hint of chocolate, with the bitterness and sweetness perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is full and quite thick with oats and a breadiness. This really is an excellent beer.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Old Brewery Pale Ale Bright copper colour with a foamy white head. Some hops in the aroma, and maybe a little candy sugar. Dryish mouthfeel with some sweet malt follows by biscuity malt and a hop bitterness. Some dryness in the finish. Clean and drinkable, but somehow I was hoping for more from Sam Smiths.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Organic Ale Light golden colour with foamy head. Some citrus noted, along with yeast and floral hops. Taste combines pale malts and bitter hops, with some fruitiness. Mildly bitter followthrough. Nice mouthfeel. This is very drinkable, although not exceptional.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Pale Ale Not the Old Brewery Pale Ale, a new one. Light copper with no appreciable head. Lots of fizz. Some light malt in the aroma. Bittersweet and well balanced, but perhaps too fizzy. May be better on draught.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Pure Brewed Lager Dark amber, with a small, but lasting white head. Clean lager smell, with a little malt and hops. Some malt and and a slight hop bitterness in the taste. Cleanish aftertaste, with a lingering dryness. A bit too generic-lagery to be with the price, but drinkable nevertheless.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Strawberry Brewed in conjunction with Melbourne Brothers. Golden and slightly hazy, smells of red lace sweets, strawberry Haribo, or cheap orange jelly. Flavour is strawberry, with a slight sourness. I couldn‚Äôt drink a pint of it, but it‚Äôs not an awful fruit beer.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Taddy Porter Pours very dark with little head but plentiful lacing. Smells like a classic porter, chocolate aromas with roasted malts and a little hops. Silky smooth mouthfeel with espresso notes and a nice complexity. Incredibly well balanced with sweetness and bitter roasted malts / hops. Nice roasted aftertaste. This should be the benchmark for all porters.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Winter Welcome Ale Dark copper with a fine, tight white head. Very clear. Pretty fizzy mouthfeel with malt and some medium-dry hops. Drinkable but not inspiring.</p>

<p>Samuel Smith‚Äôs Yorkshire Stingo Dark brown, with lots of carbonation. No head. Smells of alcohol, raisins and port. Malt flavours dominate, with a little oak and an alcohol tingle. There‚Äôs also some dark fruit and a little perfuminess. Lingering spicy bitterness. Warming, but surprisingly warm mouthfeel.</p>

<p>### Sarah Hughes</p>

<p>Dark Ruby Very dark, ruby beer, with a rich blackcurrant smell. Very complex, fruity but not too sweet. Nice, contrasting dry finish.</p>

<p>### Scarborough</p>

<p>Scarborough Stout Dark colour. Smells quite light. Also tastes quite light and thin for a stout. Think spicy mild/porter and that‚Äôs what this is. Pretty good, but loses out as it‚Äôs not really a stout in my book.</p>

<p>### Scheldebrouwerij</p>

<p>De Zeezuiper Slightly hazy light gold with a thick white head. Smells of candy sugar and perfume. Taste is heavy on the alcohol but not a lot else. A bit too generic.</p>

<p>Dulle Griet Very dark brown with a slight tinge of red, and very slightly off-white head. Smells of red wine or port. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, with a definite alcohol kick. Some dark malt, but not a huge amount going on other than a bit of spice. Better as it warms up.</p>

<p>Lamme Goedzak Slightly hazy amber with a thin foam of white head. Smells typically Belgian with some sweetness and yeast. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Tastes like a cross between Leffe and a gueuze, with quite a full rounded mouthfeel and a dry, almost tart finish.</p>

<p>Oesterstout Very dark with a red hue and off-white head. Smells porty with some sweetness and fruit. Taste has roasted malt with a light bitterness, definite alcohol notes and some sweetness. Also some light coffee/mocha and dark fruit. Somehow doesn‚Äôt really hang together.</p>

<p>Straffe Toebackk Golden with a small finger of white head. Smells sweet and alcoholic with a bit of floweriness. Taste is also quite sweet, perhaps too sweet and too strong.</p>

<p>### Schlenkerla</p>

<p>Aecht Schlenkerla Eiche Hazy orange with a thin beige head. Very smokey aroma, just like a camp fire, with bacon notes. Mouthfeel is a little greasy. Taste is dominated by the smoke, but not so much as their normal rauchbier. Some grassiness and hops with some sweetness from the malt. ABV is well hidden. Definitely one to drink cold, otherwise the smokiness is overpowering.</p>

<p>Aecht Schlenkerla M√§rzen Dark amber, with some reddish notes. Aroma is like a camp fire. Smokiness dominates the taste, but there‚Äôs a little sweet malt as well. Smokiness is overpowering if it warms up, but it‚Äôs a very interesting beer and well worth trying.</p>

<p>Aecht Schlenkerla Weizen Very dark copper colour with a small, fine white head. Smells very much of a campfire. QUite a fizzy mouthfeel, which is good as the tingle cuts through the smokiness, which then reappears in the long finish. Plenty of malt body to back up the smoke as well.</p>

<p>Fastenbier Hazy reddish brown with good off-white head. Definite smokey aroma. Well balanced with smoke, malt sweetness, some dark fruit and a nice bitterness in the finish. A bit smoother and better balanced than the other smoked beers.</p>

<p>### Schwabenbrau</p>

<p>Das Helle Clear golden, no fizz and a creamy white head. Smells slightly grassy and sweet, as a helles should. A little fizzy. Generally clean and drinkable, with lots of grass notes.</p>

<p>### Scottish and Newcastle</p>

<p>John Smiths Extra Smooth Cold, bland, very poor smoothflow beer. The only reason it doesn‚Äôt get a 1 is that there are (unfortunately) many far worse beers around.</p>

<p>### Settle</p>

<p>Settle Classic Light golden. Slightly fruity/flowery aroma. Quite hoppy taste, and a nice bit of sourness. Pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>### Severn Vale</p>

<p>Severn Sins Very black. Lots of roasted malts with an accompanying dryness. A bit watery and not rounded enough.</p>

<p>### Sharp‚Äôs</p>

<p>Doom Bar Dark amber in colour, with small white head. Aroma is almost entirely caramek and malt. Medium carbonation, quite flavoursome, particularly malts with a full mouthfeel. Nothing ground-breaking but a good, drinkable, session ale.</p>

<p>Red Ale Reddy-bronze with a small, slightly off-white head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Light roasted flavour with some sweetness and a a little dry hops to balance it up.</p>

<p>Sea Fury Roasted (light) aroma with some fruitiness. Taste is quite full with red fruit/berry notes. Pretty clean but with a slight stickiness in the finish. A decent strong bitter (first brewed in 1996, but tastes like a modern craft ale)</p>

<p>Seven Souls Chocolate and coffee notes dominate she aroma. Well rounded with a spicy bitterness and similar flavours to the aroma. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Shepherd Neame</p>

<p>1698 Celebration Ale Light brown/amber with a large creamy head. Smells of roasted malts, with some zestyness from the hops. Bittersweet flavour with medium body. Not hugely exciting, but worryingly drinkable considering the ABV.</p>

<p>Artesian Light Ale Golden with foamy white head. Biscuit malt with citrus hops in the aroma. Similar taste. Clean and light. Good session beer.</p>

<p>Bishops Finger Clear amber with an off white head. Smells of bready male with some hops and perhaps nuts. Hops are pretty dominant, but there‚Äôs some malt as well. Well balanced. Drinkable, but a little unexciting.</p>

<p>Brilliant Ale Pale golden. Dominated by slightly bitter hops and a bit of fizz. Refreshing but definitely noticeable alcohol.</p>

<p>Canterbury Jack Clear golden with a frothy white head. Light malt and some hops in the aroma. Taste is clean, with a little vegetation, backed up by a strong hop finish.</p>

<p>Early Bird Golden amber, with an off-white head. Smells of hops and citrus, maybe with a little grass. Taste is all hops, with lots of bitterness, which possibly goes a bit too far. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Very drinkable for a pint, but could get a bit bitter in the long run.</p>

<p>Late Red Rust red/brown colour. Pours fizzy with a finger of head, Smells of hopes with some grapefruit and spicy notes. Quite complicated taste and somewhat dry, somewhat too fizzy. Some sourness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>London Porter Very dark with a small, tan head. Smells and tastes of sweet roasted malt. Finish is quite dry and bitter, which keeps it interesting. Pretty good.</p>

<p>Master Brewer Choice Dark copper coloured. Bittersweet aroma and taste. It‚Äôs OK.</p>

<p>Rudolph‚Äôs Reward It‚Äôs a light chestnut ale. Some fruit in the nose. It‚Äôs pretty generic with a slightly bitter, hoppy finish. Thankfully the name is as Christmassy as it gets!</p>

<p>Spitfire Downed all over Kent; just like the Luftwaffe. Auburn, with a thin head. Spicy, bitter taste follows a deceptively sweet smell. Not bad at all, a good session beer.</p>

<p>Sun Lik Looks like fizzy lager. Large, frothy white head. Quite sweet and grainy with a little bitterness. OK for a commercial lager.</p>

<p>Whitechapel Porter (Asda) Dark ruby colour with a creamy tan head. Smells of roasted malt and coffee. Taste is quite bitter, with roasted malt. Let down by the mouthfeel, it‚Äôs too fizzy and feels a bit astringent.</p>

<p>### Shepherd Neame (ASDA)</p>

<p>Gentleman Jack Tawny colour. Pours very fizzy with a bubbly white head. Little aroma. Very fizzy mouthfeel with little taste, perhaps some nuttiness.</p>

<p>Mainbrace IPA Dark golden with large, frothy white head. Quite dry but with a malty sweetness and a lingering dry hop finish.</p>

<p>### Shepherd Neame (for Sainsbury‚Äôs)</p>

<p>Traditional Kentish Alse Mid brown, with a foamy, slightly off-white head. Smells hoppu with a little light malt. Tastes similar with a hop dryness in the aftertaste. Average.</p>

<p>### Shilling Brewing Co</p>

<p>Unicorn IPA Orange-golden with small foamy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Good mix malt and bitter hops with a lingering finish. Definitely a British IPA rather than an American one‚Ä¶</p>

<p>### Sierra Nevada Brewing Co.</p>

<p>Ruthless Rye IPA Certainly doesn‚Äôt capture the ‚Äòpale‚Äô part of an IPA. Copper, with a bubbly, white head. Light aroma of American hops. Rounded mouthfeel with a cutting edge of resinous hops. Good citrus bitterness in the finish, along with some dryness.</p>

<p>Sierra Nevada Kellerweiss Very hazy, almost opaque. Golden with a very small, sparse white head. A litle lemony citrus in the aroma, along with some sweetness. Smooth mouthful, with a little tingle. Quite sharp at the start, followed by a little malt and then more sharp dryness on the edge of the tongue. A little too gassy and sour to be anything better than drinkable.</p>

<p>Sierra Nevada Pale Ale Golden orange colour with a white lacy head. Smells of hops and flowers with a lot of citrus as well. Maybe a little grain. Crisp with an initial malt taste followed by plenty of hop bitterness. Nicely rounded with a citrus finish. Very drinkable; I wish it came in bigger bottles.</p>

<p>Sierra Nevada Porter Very dark brown with a tan head. Smells of roasted malt with some burnt sourness. Fizzy mouthfeel, very dry with some chocolate. Mouthfeel is a lot thinner than I‚Äôd expect from a porter, and the fizziness is somewhat distracting.</p>

<p>Sierra Nevada Stout Similar to the porter, with slightly less fizz and a bit more of a rounded taste and mouthfeel. Still not brilliant though.</p>

<p>Sierra Nevada Torpedo Amber with a frothy white head, which quickly disappears. Smells of pine and citrus hops. A very hoppy taste with a pleasing bitterness. Moderate carbonation ensures it‚Äôs very drinkable. A very powerfully hopped IPA, think their Pale Ale ramped up to 11.</p>

<p>### Silhill</p>

<p>Russian Pale Ale Slightly hazy amber with quite a large head. Smells of light malt with some sweetness and light fruits. Taste is moderately bitter, quite smooth with little carbonation. Slight bitter aftertaste. Decent session beer.</p>

<p>### Siren</p>

<p>Broken Dreams Breakfast Stout Jet black with tan head. Loads of roasted malt. Pretty fizzy in the mouth. Not a massive amount of flavour, some roasted malt and dry hops.</p>

<p>Pompelmocello Grapefruit IPA. Hazy yellow with a huge grapefruit aroma. It‚Äôs definitely a sir I braider beer rather than a sweet one. Some malt in the body. Decent but didn‚Äôt excite me.</p>

<p>### Six Bells</p>

<p>Blob On Looks like a generic bitter. Tastes like a very thin generic bitter.</p>

<p>### Six Degrees North</p>

<p>Chopper Very dark with creamy, off-white head. Dark and roasted malt aroma, with light smoke notes. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Light roast and bitterness. It‚Äôs a decent stout.</p>

<p>Hopclassic Hazy bright yellow with fine white head. Loads of bitter, citrus hops in the aroma, along with some yeast notes. Very bitter with a drying finish that has hints of citrus.</p>

<p>### Ska Brewery</p>

<p>Modus Hoperandi Smells of citrus and pine hops with grapefruit notes. Taste is as expected, bitter and hoppy, but not too extreme. Has a lovely, lingering hop finish. A hugely excellent IPA, and probably the best canned beer I‚Äôve ever had. In fact, it‚Äôs better out of the can than out of a glass.</p>

<p>Vernal Minthe Stout Frothy brown head. Tastes of mint, vanilla and coffee, with chocolate notes. Odd but not undrinkable.</p>

<p>### Skinners</p>

<p>Betty Stoggs Copper with a small white head. Little aroma. Very clean taste but not a lot going on at all. An ok session beer if there‚Äôs nothing more exciting on offer.</p>

<p>Hunny Bunny Golden copper colour. Small white head. Slightly sweet aroma. Some honey sweetness and a little flowery hop, along with light malt. Crisp finish.</p>

<p>Skinner‚Äôs Cornish Knocker Golden ale, smells of hops and some (dark?) malts. Some hop dryness, which is quite subtle. Very drinkable, with a long, dry finish with some citrus. Not overly exciting though.</p>

<p>### Slater‚Äôs</p>

<p>Columbia Coffee Stout Jet black with a large, white, creamy head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Quite odd tasting with a bitterness and some vegetable and mineral notes. No real identifiable coffee flavour.</p>

<p>Scorcher Pale, with a little fruit, otherwise a bit dull. Not as summery and refreshing as I would have expected.</p>

<p>Top Totty Pale golden with good hop aroma and taste with some bitterness. Nicely drinkable but nothing special.</p>

<p>Why Knot Copper with a foamy white head. Smells very bitter, almost to the point of being sour. Tastes a lot better but still berry bitter. Has a good tingle; it‚Äôs almost like drinking a pint of limbic. Not sure this is what they were aiming for.</p>

<p>### Slaughterhouse</p>

<p>Pacific Pale Ale Golden with a white head. Smells musty and tastes stale.</p>

<p>Pale Ale More golden than pale in colour. Small white head. Smells of light, sweet malt. A hop bitterness with a nice dryness and perhaps some fruit in a lingering finish.</p>

<p>Saddleback Dark copper with little head. Smells a bit sour with some sweetness. Tastes slightly burnt and nutty with some sourness. Like a gone-off brown ale. Significantly better on tap.</p>

<p>Saddleback Clear amber colour. Smells of caramel and roasted malt. Taste is similar with some bread notes and floral hop. Bitter and roasted, dry finish. Good session beer.</p>

<p>Swinehead Light golden in colour with a small white head. Smells wheaty. Very smooth with a hint of lemon.</p>

<p>Third Degree You can tell a lot about a brewery by their ability to make a good (or not) black IPA. This fails spectacularly! Smells and tastes like TCP.</p>

<p>Wild Boar Dark with no head. Some malts and a little burnt, but not particularly interesting.</p>

<p>### Sleeman Brewery</p>

<p>Spring Special Dark golden with a very fine white head. Like a golden/pale ale with a bit of malt and some sweetness. A good session beer.</p>

<p>### Sonnet 43</p>

<p>American Pale Ale Light golden. Supposed to have a lot of hops, but actually, other than fragrant hops, it‚Äôs missing something and becomes a bit boring. However, it‚Äôs certainly drinkable and doesn‚Äôt make the mistake of being an over-hopped American pale ale.</p>

<p>The Raven Very dark with light brown head. Lots of roasted malt aroma. Quite sweet with a full, roast finish. Hints of bourbon. Pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>### South Hams</p>

<p>Pandemonium Dark brown. Smells chemically, with some antiseptic notes. Taste is similarly odd. Somehow it‚Äôs not completely undrinkable though.</p>

<p>### Southern Tier</p>

<p>Southern Tier Imperial Mokah Pitch black with a rapidly-vanishing tan head. Smells (unsurprisingly) of hot chocolate. Slightly bitter with some definite mocha notes and an oily mouthfeel. Tastes nothing like it‚Äôs ABV would suggest, you could certainly drink a lot of these. On the down side, the flavour is nowhere near as strong or exciting as the aroma suggests.</p>

<p>### Southport</p>

<p>Golden Sands Apparently this is triple hopped with citrus hops. Weirdly it tastes like pizza base with olive oil and tomato. Having said that, I‚Äôd certainly have another.</p>

<p>### Spaten-Franziskaner-Brau</p>

<p>Hefe-Weisse Cloudy dark amber, as a weissbier should be. Large, frothy white head. Aroma is banana esters with some clove spiciness. Crisp carbonation and a full mouthfeel. Taste is citrus, with some wheat banana notes. Finishes with good spicing and a little dry hops. A good fruity weissbier.</p>

<p>Oktoberfest Clear, very pale gold colour, with more head than the other Oktoberfests. Some more yeast in the taste, but quite clean. Less fizzy mouthfeel and a more vegetable taste. A bit thin.</p>

<p>### Speights</p>

<p>Distinction Ale A dark lager. Sweet, caramel aroma and similar taste with some hop bitterness.</p>

<p>Gold Medal Ale Golden with aroma of grass and hops. Taste is similar. Somewhere between a pale ale and a lager.</p>

<p>Mid Ale Mid in colour as in name. Some caramel sweetness balanced malt and some hops. Drinkable and you don‚Äôt notice the ABV.</p>

<p>Old Dark Dark with small off-white head. Roasted malt and a hint of chocolate in the aroma. Well balanced and drinkable.</p>

<p>Porter Red-black. Rich and full tasting with a light smokey note on top of roasted malt, coffee and chocolate.</p>

<p>Summit Golden. Clean tasting with a little hop bitterness. It‚Äôs a light lager.</p>

<p>Triple Hop Pilsner Light golden. Smells of grassy malt and hops with some citrus notes. Taste is similar - it‚Äôs essentially a textbook pils.</p>

<p>### Sperrin</p>

<p>Victory Third Party Surely a bit high ABV for a mild? Dark brown. Smells dirty and has very little taste. This one‚Äôs not really a winner.</p>

<p>### Spey Valley</p>

<p>Spey Stout Very dark with bubbles of brown head. Slightly metallic with roasted notes. Clean and drinkable with a bit of fizz in the mouth.</p>

<p>### Speyside</p>

<p>Dava Way EPA An elderflower pale ale. Orange-golden with sticky white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Very clean with earthy and slightly spicy elderflower notes, especially in the lingering finish.</p>

<p>Snowflake Mountain Hazy dark brown with off-white white head. Some sweetness and spices in the aroma. Big flavours with sweet maltiness and some winter spices. Lingering finish with much the same.</p>

<p>### Springhead</p>

<p>Puritans Porter Jet black with a creamy white head. Smells of sweet roasted malts. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel with some roasted flavour, generally quite dry.</p>

<p>Robin Hood Bitter Dark copper bitter, with a small white head. Some fruit and sourness in the nose. Taste is mainly hops. Smooth, but not a lot going on other than a bitter hop finish with some dryness. Nevertheless, very drinkable.</p>

<p>The Leveller Dark red, no real head. Smells of (burnt) roasted malt with a little sweetness. Taste is similar, especially the burnt notes. Apparently a Trappist-style beer.</p>

<p>### Squark</p>

<p>Crex Slightly hazy orange/gold with tight white head. Citrus hop aroma with some bitterness. Very smooth with orange and a light bitterness. Very drinkable; could maybe do with a little more bite, either through bitterness or fizz.</p>

<p>### St Andrews</p>

<p>Blindside Stout Black with a foamy off-white head. Smell and taste are what you‚Äôd expect from a coffee stout. Plenty of roast notes and some bitterness.</p>

<p>Bow Fiddle Blonde. Straw coloured with floral and citrus aroma. Citrus dominates with lime and grapefruit. Quite bitter and drying. However, very drinkable.</p>

<p>Crail Ale Pale golden with rapidly vanishing bubbly white head. Fruity, slightly citrus nose. Quite fizzy in the mouth. Not a huge amount going on other than some lemon and a bitter finish.</p>

<p>Eighty Bob Dark copper with lots of bubbles and a rapidly vanishing white head. Some caramel sweetness and malt in the aroma. Quite fizzy. Not a huge amount going on other than a bittersweet finish. Distinctly OK.</p>

<p>Mocha Porter Very dark with brown, bubbly head. Aroma and taste are mostly coffee with some roasted malt. Very well-rounded and easy to drink. Pleasant coffee, bitter finish with a touch of sweetness.</p>

<p>### St Austell</p>

<p>1913 Original Stout Very dark, with quite a fizzy pour and a brown fizz that doesn‚Äôt leave any head. Smells lightly of roasted malt. Slightly fizzy in the mouth. Packed with roast malt, coffee and chocolate with a richness and a nice, lingering bitter finish. A very nice stout.</p>

<p>Admiral‚Äôs Ale Copper ale, with a thin white head. Aroma of grapefruit and malt. Taste has a slight caramel maltiness, clean with a slightly dry aftertaste. Smooth, but perhaps a little too oily.</p>

<p>Clouded Yellow Cornish Weissbier, spoilt by the addition of strong vanilla flavour. Smells of vanilla and coriander. Very light in colour, very fizzy both in the glass and on the tongue. Spicy, vanilla, with lasting creamy malts, banana, and yet more vanilla.</p>

<p>Cornish Bock Copper-gold with a large, frothy white head. Smells sweet and alcoholic. Taste is similar with a little hopping. A good imitation of a German bock. Quite fizzy, but that‚Äôs probably to be expected.</p>

<p>Cousin Jack Dark golden with very small head. Aroma of citrus, although nothing massive. Taste is very similar. Clean and drinkable but nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Dartmoor Copper with a tight white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. A little malt and bitterness and a bit of fruit sweetness give a good rounded mouthful. Nothing special though.</p>

<p>HSD Hicks Special Draught Dark, copper colour with no appreciable head. Smells malty, with a slight sweetness. Tastes darker than it looks, with roasted malts and a hop kick, followed by a roasted aftertaste. Very nice.</p>

<p>Korev Cornish lager. Pale gold in colour. Smells light and lagery, with a little sweetness. Not too fizzy, which is a good thing. Pretty crisp and clean with a lingering sweetness and grass notes. Ok, but not as good as a good helles.</p>

<p>Proper Black A black IPA. Very dark, no appreciable head. Smells of fruit (apricot/fruit gums) with not a lot of fizz. Quite smooth taste. Some burnt notes, roasted malt and coffee. Some bitter, burnt toast notes with plenty of hops in the finish.</p>

<p>Proper Job Golden colour with a small white head. Smells of grapefruit/citrus, quite complex. Some biscuity malt, but dominated by hops, which linger to the finish. Lovely, dry and bitter. Very drinkable, would probably be excellent with a curry.</p>

<p>Royal Diamond Slightly hazy, dark golden, with a large frothy head. Strong, well-rounded hop aroma. Some alcohol notes which merge into a clean, resinous finish. Also some sweetness. Plenty going on, but it‚Äôs well-balanced and very drinkable.</p>

<p>Smuggler‚Äôs Ale Quite a dark copper colour, and quite fizzy. Apparently contains coriander, but it‚Äôs not really noticable amongst the complicated combination of malts, sour fruit and bitterness. Complicated, but reasonably drinkable.</p>

<p>Smuggler‚Äôs Grand Cru Dark copper/bronze with a small, slightly off-white head around the side of the glass. Quite bitter, with some sweet notes and a huge alcohol kick. Definitely not a session beer, and probably overpowered to be honest.</p>

<p>Trelawny Copper ale, with off-white head. Smells of fruit (peach/apricot) hops. Flavour is fruity malt with caramel. Finish is dry and bitter. Good session beer.</p>

<p>Tribute Deep amber colour with little head. Some fruity bitterness in the aroma. Taste is sweet malts and refreshing hops. Dry aftertaste makes this very drinkable.</p>

<p>Tribute Extra Golden with no head. Citrus, zesty aroma. Clean and very drinkable with a little bitterness and some biscuit malt. Bitter hop finish builds. Nothing like Tribute, but very drinkable.</p>

<p>### St Peter‚Äôs</p>

<p>G-Free Golden with large bubbles of carbonation but no real head. Smells grainy. Clean-tasting with a nice bitterness in the finish. A perfectly good pint of light ale, which doesn‚Äôt seem to suffer from being gluten free.</p>

<p>Grapefruit Pale golden, no real head. Smells (unsurprisingly) of grapefruit with a little light malt. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel. Taste is clean and refreshing with citrus mainly in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>Old-Style Porter Looks pretty much exactly like a pint of coke, albeit with slightly less fizz. Smells sweet as well, with a little toasted malts. Creamy mouthfeel, with a nice level of carbonation. Well balanced, some caramel and roasted coffee.</p>

<p>Organic Best Bitter Copper, with a small head. Smells very malty. Nice rounded taste, and not too fizzy. Some hops in the finish. Very drinkable at the start, but gets a bit dull.</p>

<p>Plum Porter Looks fine - very dark with a small, brown head. Huge, sickly-sweet aroma (like the filing of cream chocolates), presumably the fruity notes are plum. Flavour is similarly ‚Äòforward‚Äô, with loads of sweetness and some spice in the finish, but dominated by sugar. It‚Äôs an alcopop porter.</p>

<p>St Peter‚Äôs Mild Nearly black with a foamy, tan head. Come ruby hues and good lacing. Strong aroma of very roasted, almost burnt malt with a coffee bitterness. Slight carbonation, with a very full mouthfeel. However, actually ends up quite watery. Some roasted flavour but not a lot else going on.</p>

<p>St Peter‚Äôs Summer Ale Golden with very small white head. A few fine streams of carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is slightly spicy with a little prickle of fizz in the mouth.</p>

<p>St Peter‚Äôs Wheat Beer Dark golden/copper with a good finger of white head. Smells slightly dirty. Quite dry with lots of wheat in the finish.</p>

<p>St Peters IPA Dark golden / light copper with a rocky white head. Lots of drying and slightly bitter hops. A little fizz, finished off by a nie drying hop flavour.</p>

<p>Suffolk Blonde Golden. Smells grainy with some light hopping. Actually tastes a lot darker than it looks. OK, but nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>Suffolk Gold Clear golden with a fluffy white head. Smells of light malt. Very well-rounded with malt in the start and a nice, lingering bitter finish. Nice summer beer.</p>

<p>Summer Ale Golden with a very small white head. A few fine streams of carbonation. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is slightly spicy with a little prickle of fizz in the mouth. A bit bland but drinkable.</p>

<p>### St. Georgen Brau</p>

<p>Buttenheim Doppelbock Dark brown, frothy, slightly off-white head. Smells sweet and string with some roasted malt. Quite smooth and flat mouthfeel, with a little roasted malt. No real hops or bitterness, but still pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>Buttenheim Kellerbier Had this at the beer tasting and two bottles we tried were very variable. This is the review for the nicer one. Medium brown, slightly hazy. Large foamy white head. Smells quite clean and is reasonably well balanced ‚Äì nicely malty with a bit of fruit. Some bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### St. Georges</p>

<p>Dragon‚Äôs Blood Ruby coloured. Smells very dark, with some coffee and malts. Nice coffee taste with some dryness and a little hops.</p>

<p>### Staffordshire</p>

<p>Rudyard Ruby Premium Very dark brown with no head. Smells of roasted malt and dark fruit. Mouthfeel is fizzy and thin. Tastes roasted and burnt, with slight toffee notes. Very average, but nothing really wrong with it.</p>

<p>### Stanley Green</p>

<p>Pale Ale Reddish gold - not all that pale. Very well balanced combination of hops with good bitterness backed up by some fruity notes. Exceptionally drinkable.</p>

<p>### Stella Artois</p>

<p>Stella Artois Clear, pale gold with aroma of grain and some sweetness. Mild sweet taste with a slight sharpness. Definitely not one of the best Belgian beers.</p>

<p>### Stevens Point Brewery</p>

<p>Point Belgian White Hazy light golden with little head. Smells and tastes like a wit, but quite a light one with a touch of citrus. Nice, but not overly exciting.</p>

<p>Point Belgian White Hazy light golden, small, tight white head.  Some sticky sweetness in the aroma and taste.  Some banana and very light spicing. Like a tinned weissbier.</p>

<p>### Stewart‚Äôs</p>

<p>Black IPA Jet black with frothy white head. Lots of fruity hops in the aroma and taste. A good bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Cascade Copper with slight hints of red. Off-white head. Smells and tastes quite grassy with grain notes. Some bittersweet hints. Not a huge amount going on.</p>

<p>Cauld Reekie Black with small tan head. Light roasted notes. Very smooth with some alcohol notes and light roast flavour. Worryingly quaffable.</p>

<p>Dakota Very dark with off-white head. Quite bitter, but not necessarily in a good way. It‚Äôs a dark brown ale, and not brilliant, but drinkable.</p>

<p>Edinburgh Festival Golden with tight, creamy white head. Smells of sweet malt with some grain notes. Taste is bready with some hop bitterness. Like a mainstream IPA such as Greene King. OK.</p>

<p>Grigors Grog Pale golden with small white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Some grain notes, maybe a little hop. Taste is similar. Probably a good session ale.</p>

<p>Hop Jock Golden with small, lacy white head. Lots of fruity hops in the aroma. Tropical fruit with some dryness and a bitter sweet finish. A bit odd.</p>

<p>Jack Back Pale golden with tight white head. Smells grassy and spicy. Clean with grain notes and some spicy hop in the finish. OK.</p>

<p>Major Hall‚Äôs Brew Golden with white head. It‚Äôs very reminiscent of Citra, with plenty of citrus hops and a nice, clean finish. ABV is pretty low for an IPA, but it makes this a very good session beer, with enough fruity bitterness to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>Pentland IPA Pale golden, small patchy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. taste is mostly bitter hops. A bit thin but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>Radical Road Clear gold with white head. Aroma is malt with one and floral/fruity hops. Big hit of tropical fruit hops and some sweeteness in the mouth.</p>

<p>Radical Road Reverse Golden with a thin white head. Aroma has plenty of hops wth orange/citrus notes. Taste is very similar, with a lingering fruity hop finish.</p>

<p>St Giles Dark brown with brown head. Smells malty with some bitterness. Taste is similar, quite light and smooth. Very drinkable but not very exciting.</p>

<p>Unleash the Beast Black with small tan head. Smells malty with definite chocolate notes. Smooth and easy-drinking with some sweetness. Very downable.</p>

<p>### Stift Engelszell</p>

<p>Engelszell Gregorius Trappistenbier Very dark. Smells dark with spice and a slight medicine aroma. Taste is similar with a stickiness in the finish. Can‚Äôt place the smell, although there‚Äôs some sweetness and spice mixed in there somewhere. Definitely a sipping beer.</p>

<p>### Stone &amp; Wood</p>

<p>Pacific Ale Very pale and a very fizzy pour, leaving a sticky white head. Lots of fruity hops in the nose. Clean and drinkable with a little fruit hop in the finish and a bit of a tang.</p>

<p>### Stonehenege</p>

<p>Dynamite Light golden, quite dry with a little fruitiness. Not very well balanced.</p>

<p>### Stratford Upon Avon</p>

<p>Dark Star Porter Quite dark. Roasted malt, smooth, chocolate, slightly sweet, very drinkable. A very good example of a porter.</p>

<p>### Strathaven</p>

<p>Old Mortality 80/- Very full bodied and complex, surprisingly nice. Quite fizzy though, so not incredibly drinkable.</p>

<p>### Summer Wine</p>

<p>Cohort Described as a double black Belgian rye pale ale. Very dark with a large frothy brown head. Smells of resinous hops. Lots of fizz in the mouth. Grass (presumably rye) notes.hop bitterness and some roast malts in the finish. Doesn‚Äôt smell like it looks or taste like it smells, but this is a very nice hoppy beer.</p>

<p>Dambusters Dark brown with a small, off-white head. Very dry aroma, with some coffee notes. Light bodied, yet very well balanced with good bitterness of hops and roasted malts. Nice long finish and very drinkable.</p>

<p>Diablo Slightly hazy gold with a small, white head. Smells of tropical fruit hops. Astringently hopped with lots of bitterness and no real attempt at balance; it‚Äôs just hops, hops and more hops. Lots of resinous pine in the finish. Definitely not for everyone, but I really liked it.</p>

<p>Lime and Coriander Saison Pale golden with fine streams of carbonation and a very large, very frothy head. Not a huge amount of aroma gets past the head; maybe some citrus notes. Some sourness and spice, with a bitter finish. Not as different or inventive as I thought it was going to be.</p>

<p>Maelstrom Hazy copper with virtually no head. Smells very hoppy with citrus and some resin notes. Loads of very dry hops leading to a slight smokiness and a strongly lingering dry, resinous, and slightly sticky aftertaste.</p>

<p>Reaper A red IPA. Copper in colour with good lacing. Smells of dirty hops. Taste is similar; this isn‚Äôt particularly good at all.</p>

<p>Teleporter Looks like porter. Smells like porter. Tastes of porter. Good porter.</p>

<p>### Summerskills</p>

<p>Devon Due Dark bronze-golden colour, with a creamy white head. Some hops and sweet malt in the aroma. Clean taste, with a little dryness and a bit of malt. Hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Guzzale Light brown ale, little head. Smells nutty, and tastes similar, perhaps almonds. A bit different.</p>

<p>### Sunner Brauerei</p>

<p>S√ºnner K√∂lsch pale golden with a tight, white, frothy head. Some bready malt and sweetness in the aroma. Clean and quite crisp with a bit of sweetness. Not a whole lot going on, but good for a sunny day in a biergarten.</p>

<p>### Swannay</p>

<p>Dark Munro Very dark with some red hues. Tight, creamy white head. Sweet roasted aroma. Taste is similar. It‚Äôs not overly exciting but it‚Äôs perfectly drinkable. A mild mild</p>

<p>Island Hopping Clear golden with an off-white head. Mild citrus aroma with some floral hops. Taste is similar with a bit of biscuity malt and a slightly bitter finish. Nice.</p>

<p>Orkney Session Orkney folk festival session ale. Smells slightly sweet and sour with floral hop notes. Very clean with some lemon sourness. Very clean and drinkable. Refreshing finish.</p>

<p>Orkney Stout Jet black with small tan head. Smells creamy, but not a lot going on. Smooth and subtle, but not a huge amount going on. Some smoke in the finish.</p>

<p>Scapa Bere Hazy orange with very little head. Slight grain aroma - made with Bere barley. Taste is very clean with some earthy, salty notes and a little bitterness. Very drinkable, especially after a long walk.</p>

<p>Scapa Special Copper with a small white head. Aroma is mostly malt with a little spice. Taste is similar, maybe with some orange notes. Perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>St Magnus Clear amber/golden. Smells write sweet with malts and light hopping. Taste is pretty well balanced with hops and some sweet malt. Somehow a bit unexciting.</p>

<p>### Sweet Water</p>

<p>420 Pale golden with large, frothy white head (at least on a plane). Lots of resinous and bitter hops in the aroma.  Clean, with plenty of hops. Very drinkable and doesn‚Äôt taste like the ABV. A nice US-style pale. Good work, Delta!</p>

<p>### T. D. Ridley and Sons</p>

<p>Old Thumper Copper coloured, with a surprisingly tight fizzy head. Very little aroma, perhaps a little caramel. Fizzy in the mouth, with some roasted malt and some alcoholic notes. Not a whole lot of hops.</p>

<p>Witchfinder Porter Typical dark porter appearance, with a lingering, very light brown head. Aroma of roasted malts and very little carbonation. Medium bodied, with mellow maltiness and a nice roasted, dry aftertaste. Very nice session beer.</p>

<p>### TSA</p>

<p>Aleoween Brewed with fresh pumpkin. Very fizzy (in fact, exploded out the bottle). Smells slightly of caramel and something I couldn‚Äôt quite place. Well rounded, with slight pumpkin notes, but balanced by the maltiness. Reminiscent of a Belgian beer.</p>

<p>Ben Nevis Red-copper with a patchy, slightly off-white head. Smells malty with no hops of note. Fizzy, and some hops come through in the taste. Good, drying finish.</p>

<p>### Tailgate</p>

<p>Blacktop Blonde Pale golden with lots of white frothy head. Smells and tastes very clean. Crisp and refreshing with a bit of sweetness.</p>

<p>### Tap House</p>

<p>Kingdom Chestnut coloured. Strange sourness, a bit like cooking apples. Nothing really going for it other than the colour.</p>

<p>### Tartu llentehas</p>

<p>Viru Clear straw lager. Slight sweet malt smell. Very light tasting, no hops and a bit watery.</p>

<p>### Tavy Ales</p>

<p>Tavy Porter Dark with roasted malts in the aroma. Clean with a pleasing bitterness. Sadly the last beer from the brewery.</p>

<p>### Teignworthy</p>

<p>Edwin Tucker‚Äôs Empress Porter Very strong smell, alcohol mixed with complex fruit aroma, combined with sweetish, yet sour coffee notes. Spicy, alcoholic coffee taste, with a bit of fizz, and a very strong alcohol aftertaste. Well balance, yet complex, but the alcohol taste stops it being as drinkable as I‚Äôd like.</p>

<p>### Tempest</p>

<p>Brave New World Golden with fine streams of carbonation and a frothy, slightly off-white head. Plenty of hop aroma, dry fruitiness and light resin. Tingly in the mouth, dry hoppiness with lingering resin notes in the finish. Very nice. Gets quite intense after a while, which in this case is a good thing.</p>

<p>Chipotle Porter Very dark brown with red hues.  Off-white head that vanishes quite quickly,  Smells of spice an coffee/chocolate. Lots of chocolate malt which leads into a definite chilli finish that isn‚Äôt overpowering but does linger.  A really good chilli beer.</p>

<p>Double Cresta Black with very quickly vanishing brown head. Smells of chocolate and roasted malt. Loads of roast malt flavour with a bitter and peppery finish which lingers nicely. ABV is very week disguised. A nice tingle keeps it drinkable. Still manages to feel rich and full bodied.</p>

<p>Elemental Dark Ale Very dark with sticky tan head. Aroma of roasted malt and chocolate. Light mouthfeel with roast, coffee bitterness and slightly sweet notes. Lingering, spicy finish.</p>

<p>Farmhouse Ale Almond + Clementine Copper with frothy, just off-white head. Slightly tart aroma, maybe with some orange bitterness. Smooth with bitterness and some definite almond notes. Very interesting and drinkable, but slightly odd at the same time.</p>

<p>In The Dark We Live Jet black with huge, tight, frothy tan head. Smells great with some citrus fruit and sweetness. Full bodied with a good bitterness that leads to chocolate and a refreshing resin hop note. Very nice.</p>

<p>Long White Cloud Pale golden with small, bubbly white head. Floral, fruity hop aroma. Taste is dominated by hops. Very refreshing with a light but lingering dry and resinous hop finish.</p>

<p>Rye Pale Ale Dark amber with lots of bubbles and a bubbly white head that leaves sticky lacing. Earthy aroma with some resin pine notes. Sweet, biscuity Taste leading to a good hop bitterness. Also some orange notes.</p>

<p>Saison Du Pomme Clear golden with some large bubbles of carbonation and a rapidly-vanishing white, bubbly head.  Nice gooseberry aroma with some peppery, Belgian yeast notes.Taste is quite dry with some alcohol and an oily finish. Some cider-like notes. Quite sweet. Complex but a bit weird.</p>

<p>Unforgiven Mid brown with small, tight, slightly off-white head.  Smells unsurprisingly smokey. Taste is nicely smoked without being overwhelming. A very nice example of the style.</p>

<p>### Terrapin / Everards</p>

<p>Terrapin Rye Copper with speckled white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste is mostly bitter hops with a very dry finish. Uninspiring.</p>

<p>### The Bruery</p>

<p>Rugbr√∏d Reddy-brown with white foam on the edge of the glass. Not a huge amount of aroma. Taste has some alcohol and sweetness, and also sourness. Somehow it‚Äôs a bit flat. The bottom of the bottle (with yeast) tasted better.</p>

<p>### The Hop Studio</p>

<p>Pilsner Tastes quite sweet with some spice and bitter, but not too bitter, hops. Matches well with the aroma. Far more taste than I expected from a pilsner. Nice.</p>

<p>XS Dark copper with no head. Smells strong and rich with some hop undertones, which give it a floral nature. Taste is rich and complex with a full, malty mouthfeel followed by sharp, hop bitterness, which lingers and develops into a slight floral/fruitiness.</p>

<p>### The Kernel</p>

<p>ANR India Pale Ale Slightly hazy (bottle conditioned) orange-brown with no head and a few spots of carbonation on the surface. Smells of American hops, mostly orange citrus but with some bitterness. Tingly mouthfeel with fruity hops and a pleasant, and not overpowering bitter aftertaste. Sweet with some resin notes.</p>

<p>Columbus India Pale Ale Slightly hazy (bottle conditioned) orange-brown with no head and a few spots of carbonation on the surface. Slightly lighter hopping than the ANR, but again orange and grapefruit citrus notes. Fizzier mouthfeel with a more rounded, slightly sour citrus flavour. Again, some sweetness, but mostly dry grapefruit, especially in the finish.</p>

<p>Export India Porter Pretty much black with a creamy, tan head. Smells of coffee and roast malts, with some bitterness. Quite fizzy in the mouth. Malty coffee with some bitterness and hops in the finish. Some slightly burnt notes.</p>

<p>Export Stout London 1890 Very black with a small, patchy tan head. Lots of chocolate and roasted malt with coffee and some sweetness in the aroma. Slight fizz and a very full mouthfeel, which is smooth with plenty going on. Roasted coffee with some bitterness that lingers in the finish. Also some smoke. Slightly oily with a stickiness after a while. A very impressive stout.</p>

<p>India Double Porter Citra Ella Very dark with tan head that disappears relatively quickly. Roasted aroma with alcohol notes. Taste is similar, but holds up well to the ABV. Plenty of roasted flavours, full mouthfeel and a bitter hop finish.</p>

<p>India Pale Ale Mosaic Slightly hazy orange. Smells of tropical fruit hops. A little carbonation. Loads of pineapple and resinous notes. A clean and very drinkable IPA.</p>

<p>Kernel Pale Ale CSCS Pours a pale, hazy golden colour. Loads and loads of tropical hops, both in the aroma and taste. Pure hop awesomeness.</p>

<p>Table Beer Golden in colour. Smells of tropical fruit hops. Lovely mix of hops. Very complex, with deep resinous, dry flavours backed up by tropical fruit. Lingering hop bitter dryness in the finish. Especially good when you consider the low ABV. Would be a truly excellent session beer.</p>

<p>### The Lade Inn</p>

<p>Ladeout Very dark brown with tan head. Pretty standard dark ale with some roasted notes. Very drinkable after a walk around a loch.</p>

<p>### The Lost Abbey</p>

<p>Avant Garde Ale Cloudy golden with small white head that leaves good lacing. Smells quite fruity. Clean with some yeast notes, sweetness and a bitter dry finish. Very clean and drinkable with a bit of fizz.</p>

<p>### The Open Gate</p>

<p>Citra IPA Golden with a white head. Quite a grainy aroma with some light citrus hops. Taste is mostly malt. Despite the marketing, it‚Äôs much more like an English IPA than an American one. Nothing special.</p>

<p>### Theakston</p>

<p>Barista Stout This is genuinely what a coffee stout should be. Very dark with creamy, off -white head. Loads of coffee and chocolate aroma. Taste is basically espresso and stout. You definitely get what you ordered! Well balanced, beer smooth, and a slight roasted bitterness in the finish. Benefits from being served a little bit cooler than a cask ale.</p>

<p>Black Bull Bitter Standard bitter colour, but surprisingly tingly mouthfeel. Slightly bitter, as you‚Äôd expect. Tastes very similar to Theakstons normal bitter.</p>

<p>Lightfoot Very light in colour, lots of fizz in the pour leading to a large white head. Smells like a light Belgian blonde. Taste is light and refreshing with some citrus. Lightly hopped, and a very good summer beer.</p>

<p>Old Peculier Deep ruby colour with a tan head. Smells of caramel, with some alcohol notes and a little astringency. Full-bodied with hops and a malt sweetness. Has a sharp bitterness that lingers. Slightly sweet finish.</p>

<p>Paradise Ale Light amber, with a thin head. Floral hops and a bit of citrus in the aroma. Very light and refreshing, although could do with a bit more body and taste.</p>

<p>### Thornbridge</p>

<p>AM:PM Described as an all day IPA . Light copper colour with foamy white head. Loads of hop aroma. Plenty of well rounded hop aroma with a good lingering bitter and tropical fruit finish.</p>

<p>Bayern Yeah. It‚Äôs a pils. Fairly generic but drinkable.</p>

<p>Chiron Clear golden with some bubbles of white head. Light hop aroma (possibly citra). Taste is also quite light with enough hops to make it a very drinkable session beer. More hops come through as it warms up. Deceptively dangerous.</p>

<p>Colorado Red Red with very small off-white head. Smells of chocolate. Cocoa and really resinous hops. Quite surprising but actually works OK.</p>

<p>Halcyon Clear golden with a good, white head but no real lacing. Definite hop aroma. Tingle on the tongue. Lots of hops, tropical fruit, grapefruit and a lingering bitterness. More peppery and resinous taste as it warms up a bit.</p>

<p>Hark Light, with a long-lasting white head. Slightly fizzy. Dry with a nice hoppiness and a lasting dry finish.</p>

<p>Jaipur IPA Straw colours with a thin white head and a hint of haze from the bottle conditioning. Smells hoppy with lemon and grapefruit citrus and well as some floral and biscuit notes. Taste is similar, with a malt background and plenty of hops. Light carbonation. Quite American-IPA like with some resin. Gets a bit more bitter as it warms up.</p>

<p>KMF Pale golden with lots of grapefruit and orangey aroma. Clean and crisp with citrus and a little sweetness. Gently bitter finish. Nice, but nothing overwhelmingly special.</p>

<p>Kill Your Darlings Dark copper with a frothy, slightly off-white head. Smells well hopped. Mouthfeel is well rounded, with caramel and biscuit notes, and good hop bitterness. Seems thick in texture, and is very drinkable.</p>

<p>Kipling As you‚Äôd expect from an IPA, smells of hops and citrus. Tastes of grapefruit, nice balance of sourness and hoppy dryness. Very pale, and very drinkable. Marketed as a Pacific Pale Ale; contains nelson sauvin hops from New Zealand.</p>

<p>Lukas Golden with fine white head. Grassy aroma. Quite sweet with a little hop bitterness and quite a lot of fizz. Citrus notes in the finish.</p>

<p>Lumford Pale golden with a small, bubbly white head. Smells of light malt and a bit of hops. Clean and dry with good flavourful hops in the finish. Excellent summer session beer, but nothing outstanding about it.</p>

<p>Saint Petersburg Black with a large, rocky white head. Smells of peaty smoke with some chocolate notes. Tastes smokey with roasted malt and a lingering pettiness. Very drinkable and doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs 7-and-a-bit percent.</p>

<p>Tzara Very pale with no carbonation and small bubbles of white head. Smells sweet and a little grassy with a bit of hop bitterness. Clean and crisp with a light tingle in the mouth. Doesn‚Äôt do a whole lot, so a good recreation of the style; not exactly a selling point, though.</p>

<p>Versa Orangey-golden with small patches of white head. Smells of banana and clove, as you‚Äôd expect. Smooth and wheat with a slight tingle. More banana and clove in the taste. Finish is clean and spritzy with light citrus notes.</p>

<p>Wild Swan Very pale golden with bubbles of white head. Smells of light malt. Quite fizzy, but otherwise a nicely drinkable golden ale.</p>

<p>### Thornbridge/Mountain Goat</p>

<p>Thorny Goat Very dark with a light tan head.  Smells of coffee with dark, dry roasted malt.  Definite coffee and savoury flavours.  Espresso goodness.  Very clean and drinkable with a dry, roast coffee finish and just a touch of sweetness.</p>

<p>### Thornbridge/Odell</p>

<p>Pond Hopper Light golden with a very tight white head with good lacing. Fruity hops and light resin notes in the aroma. Also smells quite alcoholic. Tastes a lot like blackcurrant chewits with a little floweriness and a drying, hoppy, tingly, slightly astringent finish. Also some peachy, white wine notes. Gets a bit too sweet after a while.</p>

<p>### Three Boys</p>

<p>Oyster Stout Black with sticky brown head. Lots of roast malt and bitterness in the aroma. Taste has sweetness, bitterness and a surprising fruit and hop finish. Interesting and other than the roast malt doesn‚Äôt taste that dark.</p>

<p>### Three Daggers</p>

<p>Daggers Ale Tastes quite sweet, almost like it wasn‚Äôt quite ready in time for the beer festival.</p>

<p>### Three Kings</p>

<p>Silver Darling Hazy golden. Smells slightly green. However, there‚Äôs some good hop flavour. A nice pale ale.</p>

<p>The Rock Golden with tight white head. Quite dry and bitter with grain notes and a slight grassiness.</p>

<p>### Thwaites</p>

<p>13 Guns Copper with small head. Loads of hops in the aroma with tropical fruit. Malty and rounded with some drying hops in the finish that build.</p>

<p>Chestnut Dancer There‚Äôs a clue to the colour in the name. Pours slightly fizzy (although not bottle conditioned). Small white head. Slight malt aroma. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, well balanced but dominated by malts.</p>

<p>Magic Sponge Dark copper with creamy white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Slightly creamy with little going on.</p>

<p>### Tickety Brew</p>

<p>Stout Very lively. Dark brown with large off-white head. Smells of roasted malt with some bitterness.  Full flavoured and smooth. Both bitter and sweet with a slightly roasted finish.</p>

<p>### Timothy Taylor</p>

<p>Landlord Light brown with small, rapidly vanishing head. Smells of hops with some light malt. Taste is incredibly well balanced - this is a seriously drinkable beer. Some hop bitterness and sweet malt which lends it a biscuity feel. Mouthfeel is a bit light, but otherwise excellent. You could probably drink this all day.</p>

<p>### Tintagel</p>

<p>Castle Gold Gold, bright, with a frothy white head. Clean and hoppy. Nicely dry, and although there‚Äôs not a huge amount going on other than dry, bitter hops, it‚Äôs a very drinkable beer.</p>

<p>Graf Tan Dark winter warmer, tastes as you‚Äôd expect. Average but drinkable.</p>

<p>Harbour Special Very dark copper. Smells quite hoppy. Nice and crisp with a good hop bitterness. Very nice, and certainly enhanced by being in a warm, dry pub rather than a Cornish hurricane.</p>

<p>### Tiny Rebel</p>

<p>Billabong Pale golden with tight white head. Tropical fruit hop notes in the aroma. Very nice balance of fruity hops and bitterness. Interesting and very drinkable.</p>

<p>Cereal Killer IPA Pale golden with small white head. Loads of American style resinous and tropical fruit hops in the aroma. Clean tasting. Not as strongly hoppy as the smell, but enough to keep it interesting and a building, hoppy finish.</p>

<p>Dirty Stop Out Very dark with tan head. Lots of smoke in the aroma. Very smooth with obvious smoke notes but plenty of bitterness to balance. Leads to a bittersweet finish.</p>

<p>Dutty Hazy light yellow with a huge head that fades quickly to a rocky foam. Lots of US hops in the aroma. Clean and slightly bitter with plenty of juicy hops. A decent American (Vermont) IPA.</p>

<p>### Titanic</p>

<p>Mi Lady‚Äôs Fancy Copper coloured with a small white head. Aroma is mostly hops and the mouthfeel is very fizzy for an ale. Slightly spicy with a dry, hoppy finish. A very nice spring beer.</p>

<p>White Star Quite pale with a foamy white head and good carbonation. Floral hoppiness, with a little sourness in the aroma. Quite fizzy and bitter in the mouth, with floral hops followed by malt and then more citrusy hops. Very drinkable; certainly a good summer beer.</p>

<p>### To √òl</p>

<p>Sundancer Slightly hazy golden with white head. Some grassy notes in the aroma, along with hops. Quite fizzy with good hop bitterness, which lingers in the finish. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Tollgate</p>

<p>Mellow Yellow Golden coloured. Not a hugh amount of aroma but it‚Äôs very drinkable with an excellent hop finish.</p>

<p>### Tomos Watkin</p>

<p>Cwrw Hf Smells of citrus hops. Pale golden colour, very fizzy for an ale, with lots of big bubbles. Light and refreshing but not a huge amount going on. A nice summer session beer.</p>

<p>OSB Very similar to the cask version.</p>

<p>OSB Copper coloured with creamy white head. Very slightly cloudy. Smells mostly of malt, and the taste is similar, with a little bitterness in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Toolmakers</p>

<p>Cutting Edge Quite dark brown with some caramel sweetness and chocolate in the aroma. Some spice and tingle in the mouth. Good flavour, especially in the finish.</p>

<p>### Top Out</p>

<p>Smoked Porter Very dark with a rapidly vanishing brown head. Charcoal smokiness in the nose. Taste has a good level of smoke, along with chocolate and coffee notes and some bitterness. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>Staple Golden with a small white head. Fresh, fruity hop aroma. Clean and quaffable. A bit thin, but would make a good summer session ale.</p>

<p>### Tower</p>

<p>Coopers Special Amber with a small off-white head. Roasted malts and dried fruit. Not very well balanced.</p>

<p>Malty Towers Light golden. Very malty flavour and nicely refreshing. This is a very good beer, although given the colour, I could imagine the taste is a bit of a shock if you didn‚Äôt read the name.</p>

<p>### Track</p>

<p>Toba Dark. Smells rich and roasted. Tastes similar with slight hop bitterness. Very full bodied and drinkable, with a pleasing dryness.</p>

<p>### Traquair House Brewery</p>

<p>Traquair Jacobite Ale Nearly black, no head to speak of. Alcohol notes accompany spices (coriander, aniseed, cinnamon), along with dark sugar/molasses. Lots of roasted malt, cut through by some bitter-sweetness and an off-putting astringency. Reminiscent of a very raw, dark rum.</p>

<p>### Tring</p>

<p>Jack O‚ÄôLegs Dark copper with a froth of white head. Smells slightly bitter. Taste has plenty of hop bitterness, and is clean with a nice tingle in the mouth. Very drinkable but uninspiring.</p>

<p>### Tryst</p>

<p>Amarillo Very slightly hazy golden with creamy white head. Grapefruit and orange in the aroma. a little tingle in the mouth. Quite thin and dominated by an orange and then dry grapefruit finish. Could do with more body; not very well-rounded.</p>

<p>Carronade Pale golden, smells very biscuity. Tastes very dirty. Not a good pint at all.</p>

<p>Double Chocolate Porter Very dark with lots of chocolate aroma. Thick and creamy, with milk chocolate notes and a slightly bitter finish with more chocolate. Definitely does what it says on the label.</p>

<p>### Tsingtao Brewery</p>

<p>Tsingtao Light golden lager. Some sweet grain in the aroma, very light. Slightly too sweet taste, but goes ok with food. Still drinkable as it warms, which is a bonus.</p>

<p>### Tudor</p>

<p>Winter Cheer Brown with a fine off-white head. Smells of winter spices. Taste is similar - it‚Äôs definitely a Christmas beer. It‚Äôs fine, a decent beer, but not really my thing.</p>

<p>### Tunnel</p>

<p>800 Holy Trinity Church Apparently this is a re-yeasted version of Quill. Dark coloured, with plenty of malt in the aroma, along with some dark fruit. Strange burnt/bitter taste at the start with an accompanying dryness. Some alcohol notes but a bit thin in the mouth.</p>

<p>Czech Style Black Lager Very dark, small, sparse tan head. Smells very malty with some raostedness, maybe rye bread. Quite smooth, and not too much fizz. Very thin mouthfeel and taste. Some malt and a little sweetness.</p>

<p>Fletcher Portal Specially brewed for Coventry real ale festival. Awful. I suspect it won‚Äôt be brewed again.</p>

<p>Legacy Golden brown. Very clear with a thin slick of head. Very strong aroma; smells a lot darker than it is, with a few burnt-toast notes. Some alcohol and a little sweetness. Quite flat with a roasted dryness, some sweet aftertaste. Lingering, slightly drying finish. Tastes a lot like a homebrew kit.</p>

<p>Legend Hazy mid-brown with very little head. Slight marmalade notes with a coffee dryness. Tastes of virtually nothing, just a very slight bitterness of chocolate.</p>

<p>Linda Lear Dark brown, with some bitterness in the aroma. A pretty average dark bitter, but there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>Munich Style Lager Pale golden, very little head, quite fizzy. Gooseberry/lemon aroma, quite dry. Very thin, some dryness, especially in the aftertaste. Tastes like other `real lagers‚Äô. Quite refreshing.</p>

<p>Northern Lights Golden in colour, with grapefruit citrus on the nose. Taste is similar and nicely clean. A dangerous beer considering the ABV.</p>

<p>Quill A Trappist-style dubbel, brewed to celebrate the brewery‚Äôs 3rd birthday and 200th brew. Ruby and cloudy with a large, but quickly vanishing head. Dark, roasted malts, with a little sourness. A bit odd, sort of a cross between a German dunkel and a dubbel, with a bit of gueuze. I quite liked it, others hated it.</p>

<p>Summer into Autumn Dark copper with some red hints. Small foamy white head. Smells quite sour, a little of which comes out in the taste. Also has some bitter hops. Similar to a Flanders red.</p>

<p>### Turnstone</p>

<p>Columbine Golden. Smells surprisingly like orange squash. Fruity, with a good balance of hops. Very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Twisted Barrel</p>

<p>Beast of a Midlands Mild Black with very small tan head. Smells sweet, no real sign of the vanilla. Bitter, dark chocolate dominates. Very drinkable and a good winter session beer.</p>

<p>Black Christmas Black and fizzy with small tan head. Smells like a stout. Slightly orangey, but that may be because I know what‚Äôs in it. Maybe some chocolate in the finish?</p>

<p>God‚Äôs Twisted Sister Jet black with tan head. Smells of roasted malt. Taste is similar. Some sweetness and a slight bitterness. Smooth and drinkable. Can‚Äôt really taste the licorice.</p>

<p>In Amber Clad A rye IPA. Orange with white head. Resin and citrus notes. Very hoppy with resin and plenty of bitterness. Long, drying finish. A sipper, not a quaffer.</p>

<p>Inspired Golden with small, tight white head. Smells of citrus with pine notes. Quite fizzy in the mouth. Not that much in the taste. Resin notes, some sweetness and bitterness.</p>

<p>Mmmm Munich Pale Ale Dark golden, slightly hazy. Just off-white head. Huge amount of tropical fruit hops in the aroma. Resinous hops with fruit and a bitter finish. Very nice!</p>

<p>Sine Qua Non Copper with white frothy head and a little yeast sediment. Flowery hops in the aroma. Quite fizzy with good bitter hops. Definitely an IPA.</p>

<p>The Saison From Another Place Very dark reddish brown with bubbly just off-white head. Smells slightly sour and spicy. Lots going on. Some orange citrus with a spicy and slightly flowery finish. Some light sweetness. Interesting and sippable.</p>

<p>### Two Towers</p>

<p>Chamberlain Pale Light golden, very clear. Crisp taste with a nice, long, hoppy finish.</p>

<p>Mild and Brazen Dark red, smells quite sweet. Also a lot of sweetness in the taste. Quite rich.</p>

<p>### Tynebank</p>

<p>Dark Brown Ale Dark brown with white head. Quite thin and fruity. Pretty average.</p>

<p>Double IPA Golden. Quite sweet and alcoholic, and not really enough hops to balance it. They‚Äôre certainly there, but not as dominant as you‚Äôd expect them to be.</p>

<p>Motueka Blonde Golden with sticky white head. Some aroma of tropical fruit hops. Taste is similar with biscuit notes.</p>

<p>### Tyskie Browary</p>

<p>Tyskie Clear golden with a finger or so of white head. Smells of grain with some biscuity notes. Crisp and drinkable, but nothing exciting. Slightly dry finish.</p>

<p>### Uiltje</p>

<p>Big Fat 5 Golden with white lacy head. Loads of hops in the aroma, especially tropical fruits (DIPA). Good balance of hops in the taste with fruitiness and a spicy, drying finish. Very nice!</p>

<p>### United Breweries</p>

<p>Kingfisher Smooth and quite like a pils. Not as good as cobra.</p>

<p>### Urquell</p>

<p>Pilsner Urquell A good, solid, pilsner. Light, refreshing, slightly bitter, exactly what I was hoping it would be. Very clean and drinkable, especially when well chilled on a hot day.</p>

<p>### Vakka-Suomen</p>

<p>Prykmestar Suvi Brewed with birch leaves. Orange-golden with slightly sticky white head. Has a very interesting aroma with resin and some sour notes, which I‚Äôm going to assume is birch. Taste is distinctive, maybe resin, some spice and a bitter finish. Very interesting, and certainly not a standard lager.</p>

<p>### Velvet Worm</p>

<p>Pale Ale Very dark golden with tight white head. Lots of malt and some sweetness in the aroma. Taste is much lighter with a clean, hoppy finish following a light sweetness.</p>

<p>### Verdant</p>

<p>Light Bulb Hazy golden yellow with a white head. Quite a lot of carbonation. Smell has pineapple and grapefruit. Taste is light with sweet notes and a bitter/sour finish. Quite light-bodied but very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Verulam</p>

<p>Citra Hit Hazy, golden orange in colour. Grapefruit, mango and other citrus in the aroma. Almost pithy, bitter taste with no real malt. Almost like a pale ale mixed with grapefruit juice.</p>

<p>### Verzet</p>

<p>Rebel Local Hazy golden with a tight, creamy white head. Smells slightly citrussy. Fizzy and crisp with some spice and soapiness. Apparently an IPA, but it‚Äôs not very hoppy and too fizzy to drink a lot of it.</p>

<p>Verzet Moose Blues Very red with a small, pinkish head. Aroma has sourness and bisto meatiness. Quite tawny-port-like with sweetness and tannins with woody notes. Also raisins/dark fruit. Definitely weird, but not horrible.</p>

<p>### Vibrant Forest</p>

<p>Black October Very dark with tan head. Smells quite sweet with roasted and slight alcohol notes. Really rich and full-flavoured. Loads of roasted malt, very smooth but with a slight bitterness and alcohol twang in the finish. A seriously good stout.</p>

<p>### Victory Brewing Company</p>

<p>Golden Monkey Pale golden with large bubbles of carbonation. Smells of spice and yeast. Definitely a tripel. Well rounded but with definite alcohol in the finish. Could be Belgian, which is a big compliment!</p>

<p>Storm King Stout Very black in colour with no head. Smells of alcohol, dark fruit and roasted, sweet malt. Quite full and dry, with a good hop burst in the mouth. Very nice.</p>

<p>### Vocation</p>

<p>Life &amp; Death Straw coloured. Aroma of passion fruit, citrus, pineapple and malt. Taste is well balanced with tropical fruits and hop bitterness. My only real issue is that it‚Äôs a bit too fizzy.</p>

<p>### WEST</p>

<p>St Mungo Golden with small white head. Good balance of malt and hops, especially in the finish. Clean and crisp and drinkable.</p>

<p>WEST Hefeweizen Looks exactly like a weissen should; hazy orange golden, although the head is smaller than you‚Äôd get from a bottle. Very fresh with good carbonation and some citrus to balance the banana and clove. A very nice biergarten beer.</p>

<p>### Wadworth</p>

<p>Henry‚Äôs Original IPA Light golden with a frothy, slightly tan head. Smells flowery. Quite fizzy in the mouth. Not really any hop flavour, quite flat and disappointing in general. This certainly isn‚Äôt an IPA; it‚Äôs missing the ABV and hops. All round, a bit dull and unexciting, but on ok bitter.</p>

<p>Horizon Golden with a white head and food lacing. Smells of bitter hops. Taste is a bit harsh, quite bitter, and not very balanced. Gets more drinkable towards the end of the pint though.</p>

<p>Horizon Dark amber with small, frothy off-white head that disappears quickly. Not a huge amount of aroma, some nuttiness and maybe some bready malt. Taste is bittersweet with some fruitiness and yeast notes. Dry finish.</p>

<p>St George &amp; the Dragon Amber colour. Some digestive malt along with orange citrus hops in the aroma. Blackcurrant and malt dominate the taste. A bit odd, with a metallic aftertaste.</p>

<p>Swordfish A blend of 6X and Pussers rum. Aroma has a nice mix of malt and rum. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy. Good depth of flavour with plentiful rum notes, dark fruit and a good bitterness in the finish. Nicely well-rounded and very drinkable, especially if you‚Äôre a rum fan.</p>

<p>The Bishop‚Äôs Tipple Pale golden with a creamy, white head. Smells of flowery hops and light malt. Clean, with a bittersweet and nicely hopped finish. Reminds me of a Badger beer, with definite flowery notes emerging in the finish.</p>

<p>### Waen</p>

<p>Blackberry Stout Pitch black with a tan head. Smells of burnt toast / soy sauce. Tastes dry and burnt with very little fruit. Lacking in aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Warwickshire Brewing Company</p>

<p>Duck Soup Dark copper with a foamy white head. Smells of sweet malts. Rounded mouthfeel, with bready malts and a little bitterness. Possibly a good session beer, but nothing different or new.</p>

<p>Lady Godiva Light golden with a creamy head. Smells of malt and maybe apples. Tastes grassy with a lack of hops. Easy to drink but gets very dull very quickly.</p>

<p>Shakespeare‚Äôs County Pale straw, with a dense white head. Not a huge amount of aroma, perhaps slightly sweet. Some fruitiness, with malts and a dry finish. Distinctly average.</p>

<p>### Weal Ales</p>

<p>Weal Noir Dark and wintery. Quite thin in the mouth with definite cinnamon.</p>

<p>### Weatheroak</p>

<p>Keystone Hops Copper with no head. Smells slightly sour, although the taste is clean and refreshingly hoppy. Has a lingering dry finish.</p>

<p>Miss Stout Black, with a small, slightly tan head which leaves lots of lacing. Some sweet, roasted malts in the aroma. Creamy mouthfeel, very smooth and easy to drink. Fills the mouth with roasted malts. Very nice session stout, not too heavy. And it was only 2 a pint!</p>

<p>Victoria Works Frothy, slightly scummy white head. Some sweetness and a little bitterness, with some malt; very nicely rounded taste. A dry hop aftertaste finishes it off nicely.</p>

<p>### Weihenstephaner</p>

<p>Weihenstephaner Kristall Clean, bright golden with large bubbles of carbonation and a traditional weissbier head. Banana and a hint of melon in the aroma. Slightly sharp carbonation. Very clean taste with slight fruit flavours in the finish. Also a nice spiciness.</p>

<p>Weihenstephaner Pilsner From the oldest brewery in the world (in Munich), you‚Äôd be disappointed if they hadn‚Äôt worked out how to make a good beer by now. They don‚Äôt disappoint - very refreshing, slightly malty, with a bit of citrus and hops. Beautifully balanced.</p>

<p>### Weird Beer</p>

<p>Citra Slightly hazy golden with very small white head. Not a huge amount of aroma. A little bit of hops. Taste is similar. Could do a bit more.</p>

<p>Dark Hopfler Jet black with small white head. Smells of malt and some sweetness. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Lots of bitter and roasted notes in the taste - nothing like the aroma.</p>

<p>Fire Hazy brown. Lots of smoke and chilli in the nose. Surprisingly clean with a chilli kick. Very nice.</p>

<p>Little Things That Kill Golden with very fine white head. Lots of fruity hops in the aroma. Some resinous notes. Loads of hops in the taste. Actually well-balanced. Loads of flavour, especially given the ABV. A great low-alcohol IPA.</p>

<p>### Weissbiebrauerei G. Schneider &amp; Sohn</p>

<p>Meine Porter Weisse Very dark brown with tight frothy white head. Malty aroma. Taste is indeed a mix of porter at the start followed by Weissbier. Very nice. Works surprisingly well.</p>

<p>Schneider Aventinus Eisbock Thick, syrupy and hazy brown. Very little head, some off white bubbles. Smells like a weissbier, with some banana and malt. Tastes like a weissbier, albeit a strong one. Yeast, with some wheat and alcohol and banana notes.</p>

<p>Schneider Mein Aventinus Barrique 2013 Murky brown with a tight cream-coloured head. Sour fruits dominate the aroma - raspberry and cherry.  Fruity/berry and wine notes initially. Low carbonation. Some sourness. Very smooth despite the acidity. Perhaps some oak notes in the finish. Can also detect some of the underlying weissbier (banana, clove and yeast). Very complex; somewhat like Orval.</p>

<p>Schneider Weisse Tap 1 (Meine Blonde Weisse) As the name suggests, it‚Äôs pretty light in colour for a weissbier. Hazy light golden with large white head. Clean aroma with yeast and spice. Very drinkable with banana and clove. Nice and light.</p>

<p>Schneider Weisse Tap 4 (Mein Gr√ºnes) An organic (green) weissbier. Golden orange, with a standard weissbier haze and head. Some fruitiness in the aroma. Medium carbonation with quite a thick mouthfeel. Some spiciness, probably cloves and pepper. Malts give a sourdough bread flavour. Addition of yeast in the aftertaste, which is busy, but in an interesting way. Very drinkable, and manages to taste very pure.</p>

<p>Schneider Weisse Tap 5 (Meine Hopfenweisse) Copper coloured and hazy. Standard weissbier head. Smells of alcohol, with some hop bitterness and a little weissbier-banana. Quite highly carbonated. Some bitter hops and a creamy weissbierness with a little sweetness and then a nicely dry aftertaste. Some spice and banana with the addition of some lemony citrus later. This is very worryingly drinkable for the ABV. A great cross between a weissbier and an IPA.</p>

<p>Schneider Weisse Tap 6 (unser Aventinus) Very frothy (bottle conditioned). Cloudy, dark brown with a large, slightly tan head. Aroma is quite busy, with alcohol notes, malt and some rum. Some tingly carbonation. Taste has spices (clove) and slightly sweet alcohol undertone, balanced by roasted malt. More clove and alcohol in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>Schneider Weisse Tap 7 (Original) Quite dark for a weissbier, almost copper. Not a lot of aroma gets past the large head, perhaps some banana and spice. Not as powerful a taste as some other weisses, has a long sweet finish after the usual banana and spice.</p>

<p>Schneider Weisse Tap X Golden with streams of carbonation and a small, patchy white head. Alcohol in the nose with tropical fruits, a little banana and some grapefruit. Bready, yeasty weissbier with plenty of carbonation (perhaps too much). Some cloves and banana in the slightly sticky finish.</p>

<p>### Welbeck Abbey</p>

<p>Portland Black Black colour. Mouthfeel is very different, somehow manages to be both chewy and thin at the same time. Very smooth and drinkable with some smoke and burnt toffee notes.</p>

<p>### Wells and Youngs</p>

<p>Bombardier No real head, quite dark and reasonably fizzy, but not overly so. Well balanced combination of malts and hops, although it‚Äôs not really very exciting. Drinkable, but not a great beer.</p>

<p>Bombardier Burning Gold Dark orange with little head. Light hop aroma, with a similar taste, mostly dry and bitter, with a fizzy mouthfeel. Fresh and clean finish keeps it drinkable.</p>

<p>Bombardier Reserve Dark golden with tight, creamy white head. Flowery and spicy hop aroma. Definite alcohol notes and plenty of hops. Pretty good.</p>

<p>Double Chocolate Stout Dark black with a pretty sizeable tan head. Smells chocolatey with some roasted malt (so what you‚Äôd hope for). Tastes similar, but the chocolate seems a bit artificial, even though they use real chocolate. Nicely drinkable. Not overly sweet.</p>

<p>Eagle IPA Golden amber, with a frothy white head. Smells of caramel and fruit. Taste is mostly malt, with a little bitterness in the finish. Not really an IPA, but would make a decent session bitter.</p>

<p>London Gold Clear golden with a small white head. Smells a bit dirty, almost like a stale lager. Long-lasting fizz. Doesn‚Äôt do a lot and what it does isn‚Äôt really worth doing. No, thanks.</p>

<p>McEwan‚Äôs Champion Dark chestnut with a couple of fingers of head. Smells sweet, with caramel and sweet malt. Also some alcohol notes. Similar flavour, with roasted malt and a bitterness in the finish. A bit sweet, but definitely drinkable.</p>

<p>### Wem</p>

<p>Joybringer Ginger Blonde. Smells and tastes almost entirely of ginger.</p>

<p>### Wensleydale</p>

<p>Bitter Pale golden with small white head. Hoppy with a good bitterness and light malt in the finish. Some sweetness.</p>

<p>Black Dub Unsurprisingly it‚Äôs black. No real head. Smells roasted, even slightly smokey. A bit thinner than I was expecting. Lots of roast flavour. Quite dry with smoke notes (although it‚Äôs not smoked). Long, dry finish. Nice.</p>

<p>Kit Calvert‚Äôs Ale Golden with very little head. Smells malty and yeasty. Very drinkable with a good balance of malt and bitterness, just what you want from a bitter. Lingering hoppy finish.</p>

<p>### Wentworth Brewery</p>

<p>Heartbeat Very dark brown, frothy tan/white head, no fizz. Smells quite sweet with malt. Some fizz on the tongue. Very light taste, small amount of sweet roastedness followed by bitterness and astringency. Doesn‚Äôt taste as dark as it looks. More roasted malt as it warms up.</p>

<p>In God We Trust Light copper with a foamy white head. Strong aroma of hops, as there should be. Some fruitiness, but no real bitterness in the taste. Sweeter than I expected. More of an American style IPA.</p>

<p>Oyster Stout Dark black, with a bubbly brown head. Smells of roasted malts and a little sweetness. Very tingly on the tongue. Some bitterness, coffee-like roast and something hard to place. It could be salt, or I could be imagining it, knowing that there‚Äôs real oysters in it.</p>

<p>Summer Lovin‚Äô Very pale, plenty of hops lead to a nice dry beer. Quite refreshing, could do with some more malts to round it out.</p>

<p>### Westgate</p>

<p>Sundance Dark golden, with a frothy head. Immediately seems like a session beer, with a little hop in the finish but nothing to really distinguish it.</p>

<p>### Whale Ales</p>

<p>Pale Whale Pale with light, subtle hopping in both the taste and aroma. Very drinkable and liked by most.</p>

<p>Rio Gold Pale copper. Both the aroma and taste are dominated by malt and sweetness. OK.</p>

<p>Ruby Moby Ruby. Smells really weird and strong. Some roasted barley and hops, but the smell is somewhat overpowering.</p>

<p>### WharfeBank</p>

<p>Tether Gold Golden with a slightly sour aroma. Tangy hops and fruit in the taste. OK, but a bit odd to be honest.</p>

<p>### Whitefriars</p>

<p>Olde Mild Ruby coloured with creamy, very slightly off-white head. Smells roasted and bitter with some sweet caramel. Dark and roasted taste with some dryness and extra roasted notes in the finish.</p>

<p>### Whitstable</p>

<p>Kent Coast Clear golden with light grassy aroma and a bubbly head. A decent golden ale with some malt and a bit of bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>### Whittingtons</p>

<p>Cat‚Äôs Whiskers Golden in colour with a frothy white head which has good retention. Aroma and taste are both mostly hops. Taste also has some sweetness, followed by a lingering dryness.</p>

<p>### Whittlebury</p>

<p>Mirage Dark golden/copper. Smells green, with mustard and cress. Very slight spice which lingers. Some malt as well.</p>

<p>Special Pale Ale Light golden in colour. Smells quite dirty, taste is ok but not worth getting past the aroma.</p>

<p>### Wicked Hathern</p>

<p>Hathern Cross Golden with small head. Some zesty and malty hops in the aroma. Similar, slightly bittersweet taste. OK, but nothing special.</p>

<p>### Widmer</p>

<p>Steel Bridge Porter Jet black with small, just off white head which is quite sticky. Smells and tastes of roast malt with a tingle on the tongue and a good, bitter finish. Very, very drinkable.</p>

<p>### Wild Beer</p>

<p>Epic Saison Slightly hazy golden with a frothy white head. Musty sourness in the aroma, with some apple notes. Tingly and sour with a dryness in the finish. Quite one dimensional, but nosething wrong with it. Could certainly be more epic though!</p>

<p>Fresh (2nd Edition) Pale golden with some fizz in the pour, but no head. Smells quite grainy with some citrus/pineapple notes. Quite fizzy and lager-like but with definite pineapple in the finish. Quite interesting, but not amazing.</p>

<p>Murmur Brewed with wine yeast. Copper with no head. Not a huge amount of aroma. Light taste with some bitterness, but not a huge amount going on. Drinkable.</p>

<p>Ninkasi Slightly hazy golden with a very large white head that dissipates quickly. Definite alcohol and some light apple notes in the aroma. Fizzy in the mouth. Some sourness and apple sweetness leading to a long, drying finish. Has some champagne-like qualities. Definite sipping beer; it‚Äôs pretty spritzy.</p>

<p>Ninkasi Premier Cru Ninkasi aged in cider brandy barrels. Some sour notes, along with alcohol, Belgian yeast and cider. Definitely gueuzeish. Quite a lot of fizz in the mouth. Not obviously beery, or indeed that alcoholic. Quite sweet with no real bitterness, but some deep fruit alcohol in the finish. A little bit odd.</p>

<p>Yankee Sandwich Nearly black with no head. Smells rich with a hint of peanuts. Definite rich stout with a peanut finish. Odd but nice.</p>

<p>Zintuki Cloudy golden with a small white head. Aroma of lemon and other sour fruit (berries?). Taste is expectedly sour with more lemon and some yeast, with a slightly tart finish. Went very well with a curry.</p>

<p>### Wilde Child</p>

<p>Shrimps and Barbies Hazy orange with tight white head. Grapefruit citrus aroma. Dominated by resin hops. Not too fizzy. Slightly astringent aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Williams Bros</p>

<p>Alba Scots Pine Ale Slightly cloudy, dark brown with no head. Smells of pine (shock) and malts. Slightly sweet with definite pine notes although not to the overkill level. Reasonably drinkable, but probably better as a once off.</p>

<p>Birds and Bees Very pale golden with small bubbly white head, with a little lacing. Smells of citrus hops. Some fizz. Smells quite alcoholic. Initial taste is a bit chemically, a bit bland and then lots of hops which linger in the finish. Slightly more rounded when warmed up, but the finish is very weird. Contains elderflower.</p>

<p>Caesar Augustus Pale golden with a large, rocky white head. Smells hoppy with definite citrus notes. Lovely dry hop taste with grapefruit. Crisp and clean, much more like an IPA than a lager. Very nice.</p>

<p>Ceildh Lager Golden and pale. Some hops and citrus in the aroma. A little bland but a pretty good refreshing lager.</p>

<p>Chokka Blokka It‚Äôs a coffee/chocolate stout - shock. Dark brown with a beige head, but equally good straight out of the can. Roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate in the aroma. Taste is very similar. It‚Äôs pretty intense and very, very drinkable.</p>

<p>Cock o‚Äô the Walk Medium brown with a tight white head. Light aroma with some sweet malt and very light hopping. Caramel in the taste, with quite a lot of hops and bitterness. Quite dry and a bit boring. Very average.</p>

<p>Double Joker IPA Pale golden with tight, creamy white head. Loads of hops in the aroma, almost to the point of smelling dirty. Also some alcohol. Definitely strong. Hops, but they‚Äôre very deep and not anywhere near as refreshing as the normal version. OK, but a bit one dimensional and dominated by the alcohol.</p>

<p>Ebulum An elderberry black ale. Dark brown, with lots of small, tan bubbles which last quite a while. Some tart fruit in the aroma, along with some sweetness. Moderate carbonation. Full bodied and easy to drink. Sweet, and roasted malt with a mild berry flavour, which is stronger in the finish. Tart, almost burnt flavour in the aftertaste.</p>

<p>Fraoch Golden in colour with a thin white foam. Smells floral, with some honey/nectar notes. Some sweetness at the start that leads to a dry, almost herbal flavour with a warming aftertaste. Very drinkable, and certainly something different. Well worth trying.</p>

<p>Fraoch 22 Light copper with a small white head. Some whisky in the aroma, along with light heather undertones. Whisky again in the flavour with a bit of sweetness. Well-rounded and certainly doesn‚Äôt taste like the ABV.</p>

<p>Good Times Golden with small white head. Smells citrusy. Tingle in the mouth. Very zesty and refreshing. Worryingly drinkable. Good summer session beer.</p>

<p>Grozet Lagered fruit beer. Mostly clear, a little cloudiness from the pectin, with no head. Smells of fruit (gooseberries) and grain. Fizzy mouthfeel. Slightly tea-like taste with gooseberry dryness. A good, refreshing summer beer.</p>

<p>Harvest Sun Light golden with a large, frothy head. Smells hoppy with both bitter and citrus aromas. Quite fizzy, but has a crisp mouthfeel and a dry hop finish. NIce and clean with good citrus flavours.</p>

<p>Hipsway Pale golden with bubbly white head. Lots of hops in the aroma, mostly fruity. Initially light and maybe even a bit thin but an excellent hippy finish with both fruit and a lingering bitterness. Nice.</p>

<p>Joker IPA Clear golden with a froth of just-off-white head that leaves good lacing. Plenty of citrus hops in the aroma along with some light grain notes. Clean tasting with some drying hops, especially in the finish. A very drinkable IPA with enough tingle in the mouth and hop flavour to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>Kelpie Seaweed Ale Pours very fizzy, with a quickly vanishing light tan head. Very dark amber, almost black colour. Smells like a bitter porter with roasted malts. Some carbonation in the mouth. The taste is mostly roasted malts which lead to chocolate. Don‚Äôt really pick up any seaweed, although it could add to the bitter smell. Quite earthy, with a slightly thin feel.</p>

<p>March of the Penguins Jet black with a light tan head. Smells bitter. Fizzy mouthfeel. Taste has some chocolate malt and a good hop bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Midnight Sun Black. Smells of dark fruit, which follows through into the taste. Also a little alcohol kick, some liquorice and aniseed. Smooth and pretty drinkable.</p>

<p>Paradigm Shift Mid brown with no head. Malt, sweetness, hops and fruit in the aroma. Rich with hop bitterness and a lingering, drying finish.</p>

<p>Prodigal Sun Copper with a very small white head. Smells malty and slightly sweet. Taste has fruit, spice, some sweetness like honey or mead. A bittersweet finish with lingering, flowery notes. Nice and unique, the only criticism is that it‚Äôs a bit sweet.</p>

<p>Profanity Stout Very dark, if not entirely black. Smells quite light and sweet with some roast bitterness. Tastes lightly roasted, with coffee notes. Some fruit, and generally quite clean. Mouthfeel is well-balanced. Lacks some kick or excitement.</p>

<p>Redact A red lager. Copper with very little head. Smells of citrus hops with some sweetness and bitterness. Clean with an interesting mix of grapefruit and sweetness with a little malt.</p>

<p>Seven Giraffes Golden yellow, with no fizz or lacing. Smells of hops, with some light malt and citrus. Quite complex - citrus hops, with malt and a slightly spicy dryness in the finish. Nicely drinkable, but doesn‚Äôt really stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>Stravaigin Golden with very little head. Smells of gooseberries and herbs. Definitely herbs, very distinctive. Bog myrtle? Interesting and drinkable. Can taste the ABV.</p>

<p>Talking Head Hazy golden with frothy white head with some lacing. Pine aroma with some light tropical fruit. Taste is similar with a slightly odd, bitter finish. It‚Äôs fine but not exciting at all.</p>

<p>Tin Man Tropical IPA. Slightly hazy golden with a bubbly white head that leaves some lacing. Aroma is sweet with some fruitiness. Taste is complex, or maybe a bit all over the place. Tropical fruits lead to quite a lot of bitterness in the finish. Also some resin notes.</p>

<p>Williams Red Slightly red in colour. Biscuity malt aroma with not a lot of hops. Taste is a bit thin and dull, but there‚Äôs really nothing wrong with it.</p>

<p>### Wilson Potter</p>

<p>In Shreds Pale golden with very tight, creamy white head. Smells slightly zesty. Very clean with a lovely hippy, citrus finish.</p>

<p>### Windsor Castle</p>

<p>Sadler‚Äôs Thin Ice Very pale with some hop aroma but not a lot going on. Some sharp citrus/hops in the middle with a lingering citrus bitterness. Refreshing and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Windswept</p>

<p>APA Clear golden with white head. Subtle aroma - maybe some malt and citrus. Slightly sweet with grassy and some floral hops.</p>

<p>Aurora Golden with both the aroma and taste dominates by citrus. Well hopped with a slight bitterness in the finish. A decent enough pale ale.</p>

<p>### Wintercoat</p>

<p>Oatmeal Stout Very dark with a foamy tan head that quickly dissipates. Smells roasted with a little sweetness and a hint of burnt toast. Very fizzy mouthfeel and quite thin. Lots of bitter, roasted malt and a drying, bitter, tingly finish. Nice, but lacking in body.</p>

<p>Vildmose√∏l Smells of peaty smoke, with some spicy herb notes (which apparently is bog myrtle) and a sweetness, which could come from the rowan berries. Copper coloured, very fizzy pour with frothy white head that becomes rocky. Slight tingle in the mouth. Quite sour, but balanced by fruit initially. Finish is sour and smokey, which is nicer than it sounds. Warming aftertaste.</p>

<p>### Wiper and True</p>

<p>Milkshake Milk stout. Very, very dark with small white head. Roasted aroma with some sweetness. Quite sweet and creamy with some roasted malt and then a chocolate-sweet finish.</p>

<p>### Wired</p>

<p>Flat White Black with off-white head. Smells quite sweet. Tingly in the mouth with definite coffee notes leading to a slightly bitter finish.</p>

<p>### Wizard</p>

<p>Sorcerer Copper bitter with a lacy head. Aroma has a malty sweetness and a little hop. Well balanced with a little spice and some caramel. Drinkable but in no way outstanding.</p>

<p>### Wojak</p>

<p>Jasny Pelny Very clear, light golden with a small white head. Little carbonation. Smells of light fruits, a bit perfumey. A little bland, maybe some peach. No bitterness, a little sweetness, and a very thin mouthfeel. Drinkable but a little uninspiring.</p>

<p>### Wold Top</p>

<p>Dawn O‚ÄôTime Orangey with a tight, white head. Some citrus and grass in the smell, followed by fizz in the mouthfeel. Nice and clean with a dry bitterness and some fruit notes.</p>

<p>### Wood</p>

<p>Hopping Mad A golden bitter. Quite like a light mild. Good session beer with some dryness.</p>

<p>### Wood Farm</p>

<p>1823 Mild Dark with lots of aroma - some sweet fruitiness and roasted malt. All the flavour comes from the smell. Very slight bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Best Bitter Exactly what a session beer should be.</p>

<p>No 8 Amber coloured. Smells of fruit and caramel. Taste is quite sweet, but the malty finish cuts through it quite nicely.</p>

<p>Pride Mid brown. Smells and tastes of dirty veg, although there is some hopping in the finish, which just about saves it from being undrinkable.</p>

<p>Union Pale golden, with a foamy white head. Smells strong with definite American hops. Very clean, but surprisingly litle hops in the aftertaste. Nice, lingering finish.</p>

<p>Victorious Dark copper with a foamy white head. Quite sweet and malty with a small amount of hops. Quite dull.</p>

<p>Webb Ellis Straw coloured. Smells and tastes of hops and light fruits. Very drinkable. A good bitterness lingers in the finish.</p>

<p>### Wood‚Äôs</p>

<p>Shropshire Lad It‚Äôs a generic, bittersweet strongish bitter. Drinkable but unexciting.</p>

<p>### Wooden Hand</p>

<p>Black Pearl Black with a tan head. Smells sweet with a little roasted malt. Slightly tingly, and surprisingly a little thin in the mouth. Some hops, especially in the finish. Also has some light coffee notes.</p>

<p>Cornish Gribben Golden with a few bubbles and a patchy white head. Smells fruity. Tastes of citrus, tropical fruits and grassy malt. Also has a lingering sweetness.</p>

<p>Cornish Mutiny Copper, smells a bit smokey with bitter hops. Taste is similar, with some biscuity malt. Not bad, but not inspiring.</p>

<p>Pirates Gold Copper, with a creamy white head. Smells malty with a little sweetness. Very smooth with no fizz. Malt and a little bitterness in the finish. Dull but drinkable.</p>

<p>### Woodlands</p>

<p>Midnight Stout Jet black with a small dark tan head. Very strong roasted malt aroma. Very smooth, well rounded with dark malt followed by a lingering roasted dryness.</p>

<p>Woodlands Mild Dark. Smells like a coffee/chocolate stout. A bit thin in the mouth but does manage to bring through the aromas into the taste.</p>

<p>### Wooha</p>

<p>IPA Quite fizzy with loads of bitter and spicy hops. Certainly doesn‚Äôt hold back. Interesting and very drinkable. Nice lingering bitterness.</p>

<p>Wooha Porter Black with a medium, tan head. Aroma has chocolate and roasted malt, perhaps also some coffee. Taste is very similar. Nicely drinkable, with a smooth finish.</p>

<p>### Worthington‚Äôs</p>

<p>P2 Imperial Stout Jet black with no head. Roasted smell with some sweetness and very light alcohol notes. Very smooth with a great depth of flavour. Lots of roast malt and some coffee bitterness with port notes.</p>

<p>White Shield Smells of tropical fruits, coriander and citrus. Very pale, with a surprising amount of bubbles. Light and refreshing, with a bitter, hoppy finish that lingers on the tongue. Very refreshing, but perhaps a little too bland. Very good session beer.</p>

<p>### Wychwood</p>

<p>Black Wych Very dark with tan head. Smells rich and malty. Very smooth and drinkable with a little tingle of carbonation. Rounded, roasted malt with a nice bitterness in the finish.</p>

<p>Circle Master Clear golden colour with sparkly head. Smells hoppy with some biscuit malt and grain. Taste has a good hop bitterness with some piney resin notes, leading to a sweet finish. Quite a lot of carbonation. Very drinkable but not exceptional.</p>

<p>Dr Thirsty‚Äôs No 4 Blonde Perfect if you‚Äôre thirsty. Pale, very little going on, light and drinkable.</p>

<p>Dryneck Zesty hop aroma with orange notes. Powerful hit of fruity hops - bitter orange and some berry. Not too fizzy. An interesting and thirst quenching beer. Nice use of mosaic hops.</p>

<p>Duchy Originals Organic Golden Ale Light golden with lots of carbonation and a thick white head. Smells grassy with some hops and sweetness. Taste is balanced with a good mix of light malts and hops with some citrus bitterness in the finish. However, it is overly fizzy.</p>

<p>Fiddler‚Äôs Elbow Amber coloured with a creamy white head which leaves good lacing. Smell has mild citrus notes and some yeast. Smooth and crisp with plenty of malt and floral hops. Almost buttery at times. A very nice pint.</p>

<p>Fire Catcher Golden with gooseberry aroma. Loads of gooseberry flavour too. Clean, crisp and very drinkable with a lingering fruit bitterness.</p>

<p>Goliath Disappointingly no longer comes in 660ml bottles. More ruby than pale, moderate carbonation with a creamy white head. Lots of malt, with a somewhat bitter, hoppy aftertaste. Drinkable, but the lack of bitterness in the aftertaste is offputting.</p>

<p>Hobgoblin Ruby with a light smattering of tan head. Smells of chocolate/coffee with some sweetness. Very smooth with just a tingle of carbonation. Malt sweetness dominates but is well balanced in the end by hop bitterness. Very well rounded, and something of a benchmark beer.</p>

<p>Hobgoblin Like a toned-down version of the bottle version.</p>

<p>Hobgoblin Gold Golden with large creamy white head. Loads of citrus and floral hops in the aroma. Nicely balanced mix of hops. Clean, slightly zingy and very drinkable.</p>

<p>Hobgoblin IPA Golden with a white head. Aroma of tropical fruit. Taste is similar with some malt and a light bitterness in the finish. It‚Äôs nothing special, but perfectly drinkable.</p>

<p>King Goblin Clear copper with a frothy, very slightly tan head. Smells of spice and caramel sweetness, perhaps with dark fruit undertones. Tastes of sweet malt with dark fruit and a little spice, so very similar to the nose. Also some alcohol notes, along with a tingle in the mouth. Rather like an aged hobgoblin, and definitely a sipping beer.</p>

<p>Pumpking Golden with a frothy white head. Smells of nutmeg/mace. Has a warming spice taste with a hint of sweetness and bitter hops in the finish. No pumpkin flavour comes through. Nice deep flavour, which makes a very drinkable beer.</p>

<p>Scarecrow Very pale in colour, with a strong hop aroma, also some light malt. Quite dry, which continues into the finish. Taste is mostly hops with some barley. Uncomplicated, but what it does, it does very well.</p>

<p>Snake‚Äôs Bite Very pale, looks like a cider, smells like a cider with definite apple aromas. Quite sweet with an odd, fake apple taste and a sticky finish. A bit weird.</p>

<p>White Wych Dark golden in colour, pours with a lasting white head. Not much carbonation. Sweet nose, with some vanilla and citrus. Dry and citrus-hop bitter with a brief, refreshing aftertaste. Ok, but let down by the lack of aftertaste.</p>

<p>Wychcraft Amber with some orange hues. Small white head. Quite fizzy in the glass with a moderate sweet malt aroma. Slight caramel taste quickly followed by a hoppy finish. A very refreshing summer beer.</p>

<p>### Wye Valley Brewery</p>

<p>Ark Ale Pale golden/amber, slightly cloudy. Some white head with a little sparse lacing. Slight citrus/gooseberry/apricot in the aroma, along with a little dryness. Smooth and creamy, a little tartness on the sides of the tongue and some grassiness. Dry, chalky finish.</p>

<p>Butty Bach Orange in colour with a small white head. Mile malt aroma with a little caramel and some hops. Nice crisp, clean malt taste with a little grassy hops. Very drinkable session beer.</p>

<p>Dorothy Goodbody‚Äôs Country Ale Golden/red ale with foamy white head. Nicely rounded with good hop bitterness and a creamy mouthfeel.</p>

<p>Dorothy Goodbody‚Äôs Golden Ale Pale golden, crisp and zesty with some sweetness and a very nice, slightly drying finish.</p>

<p>Dorothy Goodbody‚Äôs Ocean Wave Very pale straw colour with a small white head which leaves good lacing. Taste has a good amount of hopping. Taste is slightly spicy and floral. A very nice summer beer.</p>

<p>Dorothy Goodbody‚Äôs Springtime Ale Brewed with some wheat. Clear amber with a white head. Quite sweet with some light toffee notes. OK, but could do with some bitterness.</p>

<p>Dorothy Goodbody‚Äôs Stout Very black with a small tan head. Smells of roasted malts and some chocolate. Very smooth and well rounded, plenty of roasted malts and a little hop bitterness to finish. Very nicely balanced and easy to drink.</p>

<p>### Wylam</p>

<p>Admiral Lord Collingwood Golden with small white head. Biscuity make in the aroma. Some sweetness leading to a bitter finish. Very generic.</p>

<p>Galacia Very pale golden with tight froth of white head. Fruit hop aroma and taste - soft fruits and very little bitterness. Clean and drinkable.</p>

<p>### Wyre Piddle</p>

<p>Parrot Piddle Dark brown with a patchy, foamy white head. Quite malty with some residual sweetness. Nothing special, but nice for one or two.</p>

<p>### XT</p>

<p>Festival Special Copper coloured. Smells very sour. Tastes fruity and spicy with some caramel notes.</p>

<p>### Yate‚Äôs</p>

<p>Twice Brewed Bitter Dark golden with tight white head. Good bitter sweet bitter with lingering hop finish.</p>

<p>### Yeastie Boys</p>

<p>Kome Biru Sold as a rice beer, but also contains grain. Clear yellow with a small white head. Light aroma with some grass and maybe citrus. Taste is equally light, with some lemon. Good with spicy food.</p>

<p>Rex Attitude Very clear golden with a few bubbles of carbonation but no real head. Aroma is all peat with associated smokiness. Taste is also dominated by smoke initially, with definite campfire notes. Some bitterness comes later though with a dry finish. Definitely interesting.</p>

<p>xeRRex Hazy copper with small white head. Smells of peat with some hop notes. Tastes of peat with some bitterness. Lingering aftertaste which is peaty and dry. Quite a lot of fizz in the mouthfeel.</p>

<p>### Yonder Brewing and Blending</p>

<p>Gander Actually a gooseberry sour IPA. Clear golden with rapidly-vanishing white head that leaves a sticky lacing. Sour aroma, but not overpowering. Definite fruit notes. Quite fizzy with a gooseberry tang, which lingers into the finish.</p>

<p>### York Brewery</p>

<p>Guzzler Golden with a white head. Quite a grassy aroma with some hop notes. Flavour has lots of grain and straw notes. A reasonably bitter finish. Decent enough.</p>

<p>### Yorkshire</p>

<p>Mutiny Jet black with very small head. Coffee and chocolate, roasted aroma. Very smooth and drinkable with roasted malt and a hint of bitterness to keep it interesting. Simple but very well done.</p>

<p>### Yorkshire Dales Brewing Co</p>

<p>Askrigg Ale Golden with small, sticky white head. Plenty of hop aroma with fruity notes. Good mix of bitterness and tropical fruit hops. Very drinkable with a lingering, bitter and slightly drying finish.</p>

<p>Buckden Pike Clear, pale golden with no head. Some fruit hops and bitterness in the aroma. Clean tasting but a bit thin. Nice, lingering bitter finish though.</p>

<p>Butter Tubs Clear golden with very little head. Not a huge amount of aroma or taste, but drinkable.</p>

<p>Garsdale Smokebox Smoked porter made with Bamberg smoked malt. Black with no head. Aroma is dominated by smoke. Taste is a mixture of smoke and bitterness. Very interesting and definitely competitive with German smoked beers.</p>

<p>Muker Silver Clear light golden with fine streams of carbonation. Smells light and quite sharp. Taste is similar. Not quite as clean as a German helles.</p>

<p>### Yuengling Brewery</p>

<p>Yuengling Traditional Lager Clear amber with some off-white head and a bit of lacing. Smells of light malt, with some sweetness and maybe a touch of hops. Taste is also malty with more hops than in the aroma. Quite good body. Not bad at all.</p>

<p>### Zateck Pivovar</p>

<p>Zatec 12¬∞ Aroma of floral hops, with a taste to match, complete with the addition of some citrus overtones. Very drinkable and refreshing. It‚Äôs what you‚Äôd expect from a pils, but with the hops notched up.</p>

<p>### Zum Uerige</p>

<p>Uerige Altbier Hazy copper colour with a finger of thick white head. Aroma is hops with some sweet malt and possibly some fruit. Taste is malty with a cleansing hop bitterness. Nicely drinkable.</p>

<p>### Zywiec Breweries</p>

<p>Jasny Pelny Pale golden with a white bubbly head and quickly-vanishing lacing. Not a huge amount of aroma. Nicely rounded with some bitter hops followed by mat and then a warming lingering finish with a little dry hop.</p>

<p>Tatra Mocne Clear copper, with good lacing and a thin white head. SMells lagery, with grass and a little spice. Tastes quite Belgian, with some sweetness and grain. Not brilliant.</p>

<p>### [Homebrew] Alan</p>

<p>Woodford‚Äôs Wherry Bottle, but only for the journey between Banbury and Coventry. Copper with a little carbonation. Smells sweet with some hopping. Good mouthfeel and quite a well-balanced combination of malt and hops. Perhaps a little too sweet and green, but Alan reckoned it could do with another week or two anyway.</p>

<p>### [Homebrew] Chris</p>

<p>Kitchen Bob Slightly hazy copper with a small white head. Alcohol notes in the nose with fizz in the mouth and a good balance of malt and hops.</p>

<p>### [Homebrew] Kate</p>

<p>Barn Owl Brew Copper-red, smells quite sweet (molasses/golden syrup). Some malt and a little spice from the hops. Very nice; good work Kate.</p>

<p>Gronings Blackup Very dark with a tan head. Smells sweet with dark malt. Tastes similar, but nicely rounded.</p>

<p>### [Homebrew] Lauren</p>

<p>Imperial Stout Very dark with a brown head that explodes out the bottle. Good, rich and malty aroma with plenty of roast notes. Taste is excellent, again with dark malt and some dark fruitiness. Just a shame most if it ended up over the kitchen!</p>

<p>### [Homebrew] Me</p>

<p>Belgian Pale Dark golden with very little head and a bit of carbonation. Smells slightly sweet with some banana and spice notes. Similar in taste with a nice fruity finish. Happy with this one.</p>

<p>German Weiss Dark straw coloured. Bottle conditioned so pours clear or cloudy depending on preference. Doesn‚Äôt have the traditional weissbier head though. Aroma has light hints of banana and spices (clove). Taste is smooth with a light spiced aftertaste.</p>

<p>London Porter Very dark with fine bubbles of tan head. Roasted malts and slight bitterness in the aroma. Taste is very interesting with roasted, almost burnt notes and a very long hop bitterness in the finish. Smooth and drinkable, with enough of a kick at the end to keep it interesting. Very happy with how this one turned out.</p>

<p>New Zealand Pilsner Pale golden with quite a lot of carbonation. Frothy white head. Lots of bitter and dry fruit hops in the aroma. Clean, fruity and bitter. Does a lot more than you‚Äôd expect from a pils. Much more like an IPA. Very nice, even if I do say so myself‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Punk IPA Brewed from a kit. It‚Äôs actually pretty similar to the original, with a nice balance of hops. Could maybe do with some more fizz, but is clean, hoppy (tropical fruit) and drinkable. Pretty happy with how it came out.</p>

<p>Razorback IPA Orangey-golden with very little head. Fine streams of carbonation. Big whack of bitter hops in the aroma. Clean, with a little tingle of fizz. Loads of bitterness leads to a slightly drying finish. Pretty balanced and a bit reminiscent of a dry cider in terms of mouth feel. Certainly wouldn‚Äôt know it‚Äôs homebrew!</p>
