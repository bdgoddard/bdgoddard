<p>I’ve finally become fed up with not being able to remember whether I’ve drunk a particular beer or not, and perhaps more so with remembering I’ve tried it, but not remembering if it was brilliant or  awful.  Hence I’ve decided to make a list. Below are the 2112 beers currently in my database.</p>

<p>The rating is out of five, corresponding to:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="beers_rating1"> ★ </span> Pretty much undrinkable, I didn’t (want) to finish it.</li>
  <li><span class="beers_rating2"> ★★ </span> Poor, I drank that one, but wouldn’t order another.</li>
  <li><span class="beers_rating3"> ★★★ </span> A perfectly decent beer, not outstanding, but would happily drink again.</li>
  <li><span class="beers_rating4"> ★★★★ </span> Very good, would order in preference to most other beers.</li>
  <li><span class="beers_rating5"> ★★★★★ </span> A truly outstanding beer, get hold of wherever possible. Don’t expect too many of these!</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like to see the highlights, take a look at my <a href="#wishlist">wishlist</a>.</p>

  </span>
  <span class="beers_abv">6.6%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">Märzen</span>

  <br />
  <span class="beers_review">Copper with a froth of off-white head. Smells of fruit with caramel sweetness, yeast, bread and a little smoke. Sweet malt and alcohol notes with a dry, bitter finish. Not a huge amount going on and lacking the richness of normal Leffe.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_bcx">(bottle)</span>
  <br />
  <span class="beers_review">Clear golden with a white head - looks like Leffe. That’s pretty much where the similarity ends. Dominated by sweetness and malt with some bitterness and maybe clove. Typically of low-alcohol beers like this it tastes underdone and lacks body.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_style">Strong Pale Ale</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">(bottle)</span>
  <br />
  <span class="beers_review">Clear golden with a creamy white head. Sweet malt, Belgian yeast, alcohol and more hopping than a standard Leffe, both in the aroma and the taste. A very nice sipping beer that develops a very slight smokiness.</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Leffe Ruby ★
  </span>
  <span class="beers_abv">5.0%</span>
  <span class="beers_style">Fruit Beer</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">(bottle)</span>
  <br />
  <span class="beers_review">Red with plenty of carbonation and a foamy head. Smells sweet with some fake cherry. Taste is similar; far too sweet and weird.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_style">Tripel</span>
  <span class="beers_bcx">(bottle)</span>
  <br />
  <span class="beers_review">Hazy golden with a white frothy head. Smells of yeast, a bit of sweetness and coriander. Quite fizzy. Taste is dominated by alcohol, but there’s some bitterness in the finish. Not as nice as either of the two `standard’ Leffes.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_country">(England)</span></p>

<p><span class="beers_rating4">

  <br />
  <span class="beers_review">Very light straw colour with good lacing. Some haziness, smells of citrus, perhaps orange. Complex and flowery. Refreshing, with some citrus tang in the aftertaste. Perhaps a bit too sweet, somewhat dominated by candy sugar which overpowers the hops.</span></p>

Taste is similar, and this gueuze isn’t too sour, well balanced but not a huge amount of complexity. Tea notes keep it interesting. Very nice.</span></p>

Very, very fizzy, which masks most of the flavour, if there is any. Some sweetness comes through, but just far too fizzy.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Red/purple brown with a small slick of white head. Definite cherry aroma. Dry and slightly sour with a drying finish and some chalkiness. Taste is cough drop cherry. Sweetness builds slowly but overpowered by a bitter finish reminiscent of cherry stones.</span></p>

Weirdly a bit like a flat hefeweiss. Taste is quite sweet with fruit and a little spicing. Leads to a lingering, dry finish with some banana notes. Too sweet for me.</span></p>

Fizzy on the tongue, some lemony citrys and a dryness from the hops. There’s a kick of alcohol, but it’s well disguised by the other flavours and they dry aftertaste.</span></p>

Malts and some spice, with a twang in the finish, coupled with alcohol dryness. Also some raisin/Christmas pudding flavours and chocolate.

  <span class="beers_review">Hazy orange-brown with bubbles of slightly off-white head that mostly vanishes quickly. Smells very hoppy - noticeable when you open the bottle. Taste is initially hops, mostly bitter with a small amount of citrus. Alcohol notes come through towards the end. Tingly mouthfeel leads to a lingering hop bitterness which continues to tingle on the tongue.</span></p>

  <br />
  <span class="beers_review">Bright copper with a foamy white head. Smells of resinous/pine hops with some floweriness and citrus notes. Initial taste is a huge burst of hops, not just bitterness but a whole load going on. Eventually kind-of balanced by the malts, but then moves through to a bitter hop finish.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">As you’d expect from something that’s mass-marketed, it’s very smooth and gentle, and, whilst it’s not a patch on the export bottled versions, it’s an excellent choice that’s widely available. Famous black with white head, has roasted malts and a faint hop tang that is all blended together expertly. Not too heavy to drink a `few’ pints in an evening.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Pours black and oily with milk-chocolate coloured head, which vanishes pretty quickly. Smells of coffee, with some additional dryness.

  <span class="beers_review">Completely black with a large finger of bubbly, brown head. Smells slightly burnt with dark chocolate and cognac. Sweet honey with alcohol that goes into coffee noted and roasted malt. A log going on, but is well-balanced. An incredibly interesting and drinkable stout. Doesn’t taste anywhere near as strong as the ABV.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">At 8 a (large) bottle, I was hoping for something special and this didn’t disappoint! Has been World Stout Champion, and it’s clear why. Pours jet black, with a creamy brown (darker than tan) head, which lasts well. Smells of hops and spices, with a hint of burnt coffee. Creamy, but not as full a mouthfeel as some stouts. Contrasts with the pour, which is surprisingly fizzy. Very well rounded, with roasted malts and a nicely balancing bitter, dry aftertaste from the hops. Some berry notes. Surprisingly clean for a stout, which leads to it being incredibly drinkable.</span></p>

Taste is complex, or maybe a bit all over the place. Tropical fruits lead to quite a lot of bitterness in the finish. Also some resin notes.</span></p>

Complex aroma, definite alcohol notes, along with caramel sweetness, carob, and mild dark fruit. Slightly fizzy mouthfeel, but very smooth, especially considering the ABV. Malts and some spice, with a twang in the finish, coupled with alcohol dryness. Also some raisin/Christmas pudding flavours and chocolate. Finish is dry and slightly chalky, with warming - but not overpowering - alcohol notes. A very, very good beer. Note: The bottle I had was kept for at least two years.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Pours like oil, with a head that leaves lots of lacing as it quickly disappears. Smells sweeter than the Irish versions. Warming, dark roasted, alcoholic taste - almost like an Imperial stout. Sourer than the other Guinnesses.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Very dark, with an off-white head. Smells of dark, roast malts. Very smooth and incredibly drinkable. Tastes of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, all the things you want from a stout. Surprisingly bitter hoppiness for such a dark beer.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Dark burgundy colour, with a creamy head. Smells of dark fruit, with perhaps some coffee. Incredibly drinkable, although very complex, with bitter hops, malts and fruit. Lovely smooth mouthfeel, like a good stout. Long, pleasant aftertaste, far too drinkable for its strength.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Ok, let’s get this in early, it’s amazing. Described as chocolate Martini Imperial stout, and that’s pretty accurate. Loads of chocolate and some alcohol in the aroma. Clearly high ABV, but it’s worth it. So much going on and a lingering dry and chocolaty finish with some bitterness.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Brewed at De Proef, Belgium. Dark amber with a small, fluffy white head. Smells of grapefruit and a little light malt. Quite a fizzy mouthfeel. Plenty of grapefruit, with the associated dry, tingly bitterness in the mouth. Some spice notes as well. An excellent IPA, more American in style than you’d predict from two European breweries.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Very light for a bitter, apparently made with lager malts. Light in colour with a few bubbles and a small, quickly vanishing white head. Floral and citrus aroma with some hops. Very well balanced, malts and hops work well together. A tangy bitter. Fantastic in hot weather, understated but brilliant.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">At 8 a (large) bottle, I was hoping for something special and this didn’t disappoint! Has been World Stout Champion, and it’s clear why. Pours jet black, with a creamy brown (darker than tan) head, which lasts well. Smells of hops and spices, with a hint of burnt coffee. Creamy, but not as full a mouthfeel as some stouts. Contrasts with the pour, which is surprisingly fizzy. Very well rounded, with roasted malts and a nicely balancing bitter, dry aftertaste from the hops. Some berry notes. Surprisingly clean for a stout, which leads to it being incredibly drinkable.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Very dark with a large tan head which lingers nicely. Aroma is complex, dominated by roasted malts and a notable oat smell (porridge?), some sweet caramel and bitter chocolate, also some hops. Tastes very dark, with notable oatiness. A hint of chocolate, with the bitterness and sweetness perfectly balanced. Mouthfeel is full and quite thick with oats and a breadiness. This really is an excellent beer.</span></p>

Silky smooth mouthfeel with espresso notes and a nice complexity. Incredibly well balanced with sweetness and bitter roasted malts / hops. Nice roasted aftertaste. This should be the benchmark for all porters.</span></p>

  <span class="beers_review">Smells of citrus and pine hops with grapefruit notes. Taste is as expected, bitter and hoppy, but not too extreme. Has a lovely, lingering hop finish. A hugely excellent IPA, and probably the best canned beer I’ve ever had. In fact, it’s better out of the can than out of a glass.</span></p>

You definitely get what you ordered! Well balanced, beer smooth, and a slight roasted bitterness in the finish. Benefits from being served a little bit cooler than a cask ale.</span></p>

Some bitter hops and a creamy weissbierness with a little sweetness and then a nicely dry aftertaste. Some spice and banana with the addition of some lemony citrus later. This is very worryingly drinkable for the ABV. A great cross between a weissbier and an IPA.</span></p>
