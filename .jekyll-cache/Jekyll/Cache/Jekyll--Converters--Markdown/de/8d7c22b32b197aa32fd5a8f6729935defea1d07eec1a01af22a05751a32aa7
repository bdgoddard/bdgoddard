<p>I am interested in the derivation and analysis of reduced models for complex physical systems. In particular, I use a synergistic approach combining modelling, mathematical analysis and numerics to study phenomena in a wide range of mathematical physics including <a href="#soft-matter">soft/condensed matter physics</a>, <a href="#quantum-molecular-dynamics">quantum molecular dynamics</a>, and the <a href="#electronic-structure">electronic structure</a> of atoms and molecules.  I also have interests in <a href="#mathematical-biology">Mathematical Biology</a> and <a href="#PDE-constrained-optimisation">PDE-constrained optimisation</a>.</p>

<p>Soft matter is a broad (and, for a mathematicianâ€™s point of view, poorly defined) term that describes materials that are easily deformed under the application of external forces, such as gravity or pressure,
at room temperature  Typical everyday examples include soaps, gels, foams, paints, gels, liquid crystals and biological matter.  The aim of this research is to understand and elucidate the fundamental physics behind the behaviour of such materials both in and our of equilibrium.</p>

<p>Such effects are highly multiscale since interactions on the microscopic, particle-size scale strongly affect the  macroscopic behaviour. Such problems require a careful combination of modelling, rigorous mathematical analysis and numerics.  Since the experimental observation of Brownian motion in the 19th century and the foundation of statistical mechanics by Einstein at the start of the 20th century, colloidal fluids (consisting of many microscopic particles suspended in a fluid bath) have been model systems for both experimental and theoretical scrutiny.  Typical examples of colloidal fluids are milk, blood and ink, and recent advances in biophysics and nanotechnology have stimulated great interest in the dynamics of such soft matter.</p>

<p>Due to the large numbers of particles, direct computation of the dynamics becomes intractable and reduced models are necessary. Ideally, we would like reduced equations with dimension independent of the number of particles. In recent years one such class of models, known as dynamical density functional theories (DDFTs), has received increasing attention. Existing DDFTs neglect either the inertia of the colloidal particles, or hydrodynamic interactions (bath-mediated forces), or both. However, these effects are crucial for understanding the dynamics of many colloidal systems and a more general DDFT is required.</p>

<p>We have rigorously derived a DDFT formalism including all crucial physical effects, which contains many existing DDFTs as special cases.  Via a rigorous homogenization argument, we have shown that the true DDFT in the high friction limit differs from that obtained by more heuristic arguments.  In particular, the rigorously-derived DDFT included a density-dependent diffusion tensor. We have also implemented an efficient numerical scheme based on the extension of spectral methods to integro-partial-differential equations to solve DDFTs. The scheme allows us to demonstrate the excellent agreement with the full underlying stochastic dynamics for a range of systems and to tackle a wide range of problems in soft matter.</p>
