  Jack The Sipper

  <br />Nearly black with bubbly off-white head. Smells of chocolate and coffee. Roasted malt, sweetness and chocolate aftertaste combine with a tingly mouthfeel to make a very drinkable London porter.</p>

  Hella Helles

  <br />Brewed in response to media criticism of BrewDog’s recent high percentage beers. Smells of raw hops, with an initial hop blast, folowed by a long malt-heavy, somewhat sweet finish. Surprisingly dark, with a good head. Develops an increasingly hoppy aftertaste. Other than tasting slightly unfinished, you’d never know this was so weak.</p>

  Native Son

  <br />Double IPA. Slightly hazy dark golden/orange, with small white head. Some hops in the aroma, but not as much as I expected. Same in the taste, although there is a long, bitter finish.</p>

  Raspberry Blitz

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Slot Machine
  </span>
  <br />Red rye IPA. Dark red with frothy and sticky off-white head. Aroma has citrus and some sweetness, as well as rye notes. Plenty of hops with dry, resin dominating. Finish is quite spicy with a lingering, dry bitterness.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Strawberry Blitz
  </span>
  <br />Very cloudy as pink - looks like pink grapefruit juice. Definite aroma of strawberries. Taste is initially a little strawberry with a sourness in the finish, but not too harsh. Berliner Weiss style.</p>

  Bristol Hefe
  </span>
  <br />Hazy orange with frothy head. Smells of yeast, with a bubblegum sweetness along with pineapple and mango. Tastes quite sweet with banana and yeast. Leads to a bitter, dry and fruity finish. Not as good as many German weisses.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Bristol Stout

  <br />Slight red tinge with very little head. Some roasted malts in the aroma. Quite light and fizzy with some dry roasted notes which linger well.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Chocolate Stout

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Creme Brulee
  </span>
  <br />Aged in rum casks. Dark with a tan head. Definite alcohol notes in the aroma. Mostly rum in the mouth, with no real vanilla or sweetness. Not really what it says on the bottle, but a nice rum cask stout.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Exhibition

<p>3</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Gold
  </span>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Imperial Bourbon

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Mocha
  </span>
  <br />Dark with a tan head. Unsurprisingly smells of mocha with lots of coffee (like coffee cream sweets). Coffee at the start of the taste, leading to chocolate and then back into a coffee aftertaste.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Number 7

  <br />Pale copper and smells more roasted than you’d expect from the colour. Long, lingering dryness with a bit of malt and some greenness.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Port
  </span>
  <br />Dark with a tan head. Some port aroma. Also port notes in the aftertaste, which overpowers any sweet or roasted notes there may have been in the original stout.</p>

<p>3</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Raspberry Stout
  </span>
  <br />Smells of raspberry but in a synthetic way. Initial taste is in fact raspberry with good sourness, but then leads to a syrupy sweetness reminiscent of cough medicine.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">

  Black Chocolate Stout

  Insulated
  </span>
  <br />Guessing that this is a take on a German Dunkel (I drank it with a German, anyway). Very dark with tight and large off-white head. Roasted and almost nutty aroma. Taste is light and drinkable, whilst still being complex enough to keep it interesting. Would like to try again.</p>

<p><span class="beers_rating1">
  Local 1

  <br />pale golden with some streams of carbonation. Small finger of white head. Hops and soft fruit (banana/pineapple) in the smell, along with some candy sugar. Quite fizzy mouthfeel, with alcoholic notes, some pepper and a slightly metallic taste. Dry finish, but a bit sticky.</p>

<p>3</p>

  Scorcher IPA

  400 Pound Monkey

  <br />Light amber, with a thin white head. Aroma is dry hops, some alcohol and citrus, so what you’d expect from an IPA. Quite a floral taste with some dryness and a contrasting, rounded malt. Some alcohol dryness in the finish, along with some tea-like notes. A little astringent in the aftertaste.</p>

  Grozet
  </span>
  <br />Lagered fruit beer. Mostly clear, a little cloudiness from the pectin, with no head. Smells of fruit (gooseberries) and grain. Fizzy mouthfeel. Slightly tea-like taste with gooseberry dryness. A good, refreshing summer beer.</p>

  Kelpie Seaweed Ale
  </span>
  <br />Pours very fizzy, with a quickly vanishing light tan head. Very dark amber, almost black colour. Smells like a bitter porter with roasted malts. Some carbonation in the mouth. The taste is mostly roasted malts which lead to chocolate. Don’t really pick up any seaweed, although it could add to the bitter smell. Quite earthy, with a slightly thin feel.</p>
