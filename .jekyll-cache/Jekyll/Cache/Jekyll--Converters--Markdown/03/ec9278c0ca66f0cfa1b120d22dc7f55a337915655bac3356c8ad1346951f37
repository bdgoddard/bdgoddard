      <p><i>Chemistry in Focus</i> is a student lead and Royal Society of Chemistry funded project in the School of Chemistry at Edinbrugh Uni to popularise publications lead by PhD students within the School. The main idea is to use short 3-5 minute Youtube Videos to explain a scientific paper in a way that it is understandable for anyone.</p>
